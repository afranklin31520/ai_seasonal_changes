US Treasury Says AI Tools Prevented $1 Billion of Fraud in 2024,Todd Feathers,2024-10-17,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury says its expanded use of machine learning systems helped detect and prevent billions of dollars in fraudulent payments in 2024. The treasury is the check-writer for many federal programs and annually processes around 1.4 billion payments worth $6.9 trillion for programs like Social Security and Medicaid. During the most recent fiscal year, which ended in September, the agency’s new data-driven approach to rooting out bad actors contributed to the prevention and recovery of more than $4 billion in fraudulent payments, according to a press release. That’s a more than sixfold increase over the $652.7 million in fraudulent payments detected or recovered during the 2023 fiscal year. The agency credited the increase to its new data-driven approach to fraud detection. That includes using machine learning to identify instances of fraud and to prioritize high-risk transactions for further investigation. The Treasury has also partnered with other federal and state agencies to share information through its Do Not Pay database and other payment integrity tools. âTreasury takes seriously our responsibility to serve as effective stewards of taxpayer money. Helping ensure that agencies pay the right person, in the right amount, at the right time is central to our efforts,â Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement. âWeâve made significant progress during the past year in preventing over $4 billion in fraudulent and improper payments. We will continue to partner with others in the federal government to equip them with the necessary tools, data, and expertise they need to stop improper payments and fraud.â While $4 billion in fraudulent payments prevented or recovered is no small amount, it pales in comparison to the government’s estimates of how much fraud occurs. In April, the federal Government Accountability Office estimated that federal agencies lose between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud. The GAO report recommended that the Treasury, due to its central role in processing payments, should better leverage data analytics tools. Both government agencies and financial institutions have increasingly come to rely on machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent actors. These systems use a wide range of data about payment recipientsâincluding details about their bank accounts, physical addresses, IP addresses, demographic information, usernames, and passwordsâto identify patterns linked with fraud. As the Treasury has noted in previous reports about financial sector fraud, that kind of “historical data used to train fraud-detection models could contain biases, such as the overrepresentation of certain demographics in anti-fraud cases.” AiDepartment of the TreasuryFraud Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

"For the Love of God, Stop Making Inscrutable Doomsday Clocks",Matthew Gault,2024-10-15,"A Saudi-backed business school in Switzerland has launched a Doomsday Clock to warn the world about the harms of âuncontrolled artificial general intelligence,â what it calls a âgod-likeâ AI. Imagine if the people selling offices on Excel spreadsheets in the 1980s tried to tell workers that the software was a pathway to birthing a god and used a ticking Rolex to do it and youâll have an idea of what weâre dealing with here. Michael Wadeâthe clock’s creator and a TONOMUS Professor of Strategy and Digital at IMD Business School in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Director of the TONOMUS Global Center for Digital and AI Transformation (good lord)âunveiled the clock in a recent op-ed for TIME. A clock ticking down to midnight is a once-powerful and now stale metaphor from the atomic age. Itâs an image so old and stayed that it just celebrated its 75th anniversary. After America dropped nukes on Japan, some researchers and scientists whoâd worked on developing the weapon formed the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Their project has been to warn the world of its impending destruction. The Doomsday Clock is one of the ways they do it. Every year experts in various fieldsâfrom nuclear weapons to climate change to, yes, artificial intelligenceâgather and discuss just how screwed the world is. Then they set the clock. The closer to midnight, the closer humanity is to its doom. Right now itâs at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest the clock has ever been set. Wade and IMD have no relation to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Doomsday Clock is its own thing. Wadeâs creation is the AI Safety Clock. âThe Clockâs current readingâ29 minutes to midnightâis a measure of just how close we are to the critical tipping point where uncontrolled AGI could bring about existential risks,â he said in his Time article. âWhile no catastrophic harm has happened yet, the breakneck speed of AI development and the complexities of regulation mean that all stakeholders must stay alert and engaged.â Silicon Valleyâs loudest AI proponents love to lean into the nuclear metaphor. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman compared the work of his company to the Manhattan Project. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) wrote that Americaâs rush to embrace AI is similar to Oppenheimerâs pursuit of the atomic bomb. Some of this fear and concern might be genuine but itâs all marketing at the end of the day. Weâre in the middle of a hype cycle around AI. Companies are promising it can deliver unprecedented returns and destroy labor costs. Machines, they say, will soon do everything for us. The reality is that AI is useful but also mostly moves labor and production costs to other parts of the chain where the end user doesnât see it. The fear of AI becoming so advanced that it wipes humanity out is just another kind of hype. Doomerism about word calculators and predictive modeling systems is just another way to get people excited about the possibilities of this technology and mask the real harm it creates. At a recent Tesla event, robot bartenders poured drinks for attendees. By all appearances, they were controlled remotely by humans. LLMs burn a ton of water and electricity when coming up with answers and often rely on the subtle and constant attention of human âtrainersâ who labor in poor countries and work for a pittance. Humans use the tech to flood the internet with non-consensually created nude images of other humans. These are just a few of the real-world harms already caused by Silicon’s rapid embrace of AI. And as long as youâre afraid of Skynet coming to life and wiping out humanity in the future, you arenât paying attention to the problems right in front of you. The Bulletinâs Doomsday Clock may be inscrutable on the surface, but thereâs an army of impressive minds behind the metaphor churning out work every day about the real risks of nuclear weapons and new technologies. In September, the Bulletin put a picture of Altman in an article debunking hyperbolic claims about how AI might be used to engineer new bioweapons. âFor all the doomsaying, there are actually many uncertainties in how AI will affect bioweapons and the wider biosecurity arena,â the article said. It also stressed that talk of extreme scenarios around AI helps people avoid having more difficult conversations. âThe challenge, as it has been for more than two decades, is to avoid apathy and hyperbole about scientific and technological developments that impact biological disarmament and efforts to keep biological weapons out of the war plans and arsenals of violent actors,â the Bulletin said. âDebates about AI absorb high-level and community attention and â¦ they risk an overly narrow threat focus that loses sight of other risks and opportunities.â There are dozens of articles like this published every year by the people who run the Doomsday Clock. The Swiss AI clock has no such scientific backing, though it claims to be monitoring such articles in its FAQ. What it has, instead, is money from Saudi Arabia. Wadeâs position at the school is possible thanks to funding from TONOMUS, a subsidiary of NEOM. NEOM is Saudi Arabiaâs much-hyped city of the future that itâs attempting to build in the desert. Among the other promises of NEOM are robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a giant artificial moon. Youâll forgive me if I donât take Wade or the AI Safety Clock seriously.

Parents Sue School That Gave Bad Grade to Student Who Used AI to Complete Assignment,Todd Feathers,2024-10-15,"An old and powerful force has entered the fraught debate over generative AI in schools: litigious parents angry that their child may not be accepted into a prestigious university. In what appears to be the first case of its kind, at least in Massachusetts, a couple has sued their local school district after it disciplined their son for using generative AI tools on a history project. Dale and Jennifer Harris allege that the Hingham High School student handbook did not explicitly prohibit the use of AI to complete assignments and that the punishment visited upon their son for using an AI toolâhe received Saturday detention and a grade of 65 out of 100 on the assignmentâhas harmed his chances of getting into Stanford University and other elite schools. “The defendants continued on a pervasive, destructive and merciless path of threats, intimidation and coercion to impact and derail [our son’s] future and his exemplary record,” the Harris family alleges in its lawsuit, which was initially filed in state superior court before being removed to a federal district court. Hingham Public Schools, however, claims that its student handbook prohibited the use of “unauthorized technology” and “unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one’s own work.” The district said in a recent motion to dismiss that the discipline administered to the Harris’ son was “relatively lenient” and that a ruling to the contrary would “invite dissatisfied parents and students to challenge day-to-day discipline, even grading of students, in state and federal courts.” Almost immediately after OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022,Â  schools recognized the threat that free and easily accessible generative AI tools posed to academic integrity. Some districts tried banning the technology entirely for students and then reversed course. State departments of education have slowly been rolling out guidance for local districts, but in many parts of the country, there is no clear consensus on how students should be allowed to use generative AI. A national survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Technology found that schools are increasingly disciplining students for using AI and noted that historically marginalized studentsâincluding students of color and English language learnersâtend to be punished disproportionately for violating school rules, The Harris family alleges that their son was unfairly targeted by the Hingham school district because it applied discipline inconsistently. After the cheating incident, the district didn’t place their son in the National Honor Society, they claim, but it had previously allowed a student who used AI to write an English paper to join the society. The district replied in its motion to dismiss that the Harris’s son has, in fact, been allowed to join the National Honor Society after initially being deferred. The lawsuit also questions whether using AI to complete assignments should be prohibited at all. It notes that the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education hasn’t issued any rules or guidance for schools on the use of the technology. “Generative AI is an emerging landscape and its use is here to stay,” according to the lawsuit. generative aiLawsuitMassachusettsSchool Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The Federal Government Is Too Broke and Stupid for the AI Revolution,Matthew Gault,2024-10-11,"Love it or hate it, AI is blooming in offices across the world. Unless those offices are full of employees working for the U.S. federal government. A new report from Fedscoop casts doubt on Washingtonâs ability to keep up with the times. According to its analysis of multiple federal agencies, D.C. doesnât have the funds or the talent to train to keep up with AI. Last year, President Joe Biden watched Mission: ImpossibleâDead Reckoning Part One and got freaked out about AI. It scared him so bad that he signed an executive order that called on tech companies to develop the tech responsibly. The White House also called on federal agencies to issue reports that would detail how they plan to use AI, their plans to mitigate risks against humanity, and to elaborate on what barriers stood in the way of mass adoption of AI. The White House wanted these reports posted publicly by September. Most of the federal agencies replied and Fedscoop has collected them all in one place and found a common theme. According to Fedscoop, twenty-nine agencies submitted reports. A dozen of them mentioned data hurdles, six mentioned a lack of AI-trained employees, and six said that a lack of funding was hurting their AI initiatives. The Department of Energy, which is in charge of the nationâs nuclear arsenal, complained that understandable security concerns around cloud services are preventing it from ramping up its adoption of AI. It also doesnât have enough graphics cards. âThe IT infrastructure barrier extends beyond the serverless CSP services to the availability and timeliness of securing virtual machines with the requisite Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hardware to develop, train, manage, and deploy advanced AI models,â a DOE report on its adoption of AI said. âThis challenge is industry-wide; however, it will impact the rollout and adoption of more advanced customized use cases that require dedicated GPU hardware.â The recurring data problem is a big one. Many of these federal agencies have been around for decades. People drift in and out, some sticking around for years and others cycling in and out with each new presidential administration. Many of the technological systems at these agencies are ad-hoc in nature. Things get replaced when they absolutely have to be, but not before. A great example of this is Americaâs nuclear weapons systems. The Air Force used enormous eight-inch floppy discs to run the software governing nuclear command and control until 2019. When Colin Powell became Secretary of State under George W. Bush in 2001, he discovered that his office was full of pre-internet era computers designed by a company that had gone bankrupt in 1992. The mass adoption of AI is forcing D.C. to face similar technology challenges all at once across all its departments. The data problem, repeated over a dozen reports, is a reflection of this ad-hoc build-up. Training internal LLMs for government use requires data to be centralized and secure. In many of these agencies, data is distributed in hundreds of different places and few off-the-shelf solutions are secure enough for government work. Another theme was a lack of understanding of AI in the workforce and an outright fear of it. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which deals with nuclear power plants and radioactive materials, said its workforce was interested but âit has also expressed trepidation as well as a general lack of knowledge of AI capabilities. To address this, the agency must continue to enable effective change management to enable the workforce to take full advantage of AI capabilities as they are introduced.â Many of the agencies also complained about funding. The NRC said it was âonly able to assess, test, implement, and maintain new capabilities where resources have been made available to do so.â âAI use cases compete for funding and staffing with other important priorities at the Bank including non-IT investments in core EXIM capabilities, cyber security, and other use cases in our modernization agenda,â the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. said in its report. Itâs going to be expensive and time-consuming for these agencies to catch up with the rest of the country. Back in 2001, Powell had to buy everyone in his office a computer, 44,000 machines to hear him tell it. âDonât ask me how I got the money, because I wonât tell you,â he said at an IT symposium in 2019.

"Congressman Refuses to Debate, so His Opponent Is Using an AI Stand-In",Tom Maxwell,2024-10-09,"Letâs say you want to make a long-shot run for Congress as an independent in a deeply Democratic district of Virginia, but the incumbent in the race wonât give you airtime to debate your respective platforms in front of voters. You could simply run social media ads promoting your candidacy, or maybe present your case through a YouTube video in which you argue why you’re a better choice. Maybe contact the local newspaper to try and get an interview? Or you could just use generative AI that’s been trained on the incumbent’s backlog of public comments and published material.Â Thatâs what Bentley Hensel intends to do in Virginiaâs 8th congressional district, where heâs running as an independent challenger against Don Beyer, who has brushed off requests to do another debate, saying a September forum was sufficient. Beyer won the district in 2022 by nearly two-thirds, so it’s not hard to see why he would feel it better to just ignore his relatively unknown challenger. It may be hard for some to suspend disbelief listening to a simulacrum of a real person. But ChatGPTâs Advanced Voice Mode is so uncanny in its ability to speak in a natural and expressive way that itâs hard to even distinguish it from a real person. And companies like Character.ai and Replika are wildly popular for offering chatbots as forms of companionship. Itâs not crazy to believe that voters, especially older ones, would be lulled into feeling they’re watching a genuine debate.Â Hensel told Reuters that DonBot, as the bot is called, is being trained using ChatGPTâs API on Beyerâs official websites, press releases, and data from the Federal Election Commission. The bot is intended to provide accurate answers, though thatâs not exactly reassuring to anyone who has actually used a chatbot before. And sure enough, Reuters tested DonBot and found that although it largely provided straightforward answers to policy questions, it erred in saying Beyer has not endorsed anyone for president when he has in fact endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Still, having been trained on a narrow data set, the bot is less likely to produce wild hallucinations.Â Beyer did not tell Reuters whether or not heâll take action to stop the online debate, taking place on October 17, but a spokesperson told the outlet that Beyer “continues to be a leading voice in Congress on the need to improve artificial intelligence regulation, including legislation to prevent nefarious actors from utilizing AI to spread election misinformation.” So, it sounds like heâs not exactly enthused.Â Legal experts who spoke with Reuters said that the use of the bot is likely permissible so long as Hensel offers clear disclosure that heâs not actually speaking to the real Don Beyer. For Hensel, the attention he’s getting from creating the bot alone has probably been worth a lot. It seems slippery, however, if older voters and others come to wrongly believe a bot that is likely going to make some mistakes genuinely represents a candidate. We know it’s already easy enough for older generations to fall for AI-generated imagery.Â At least 26 states have moved to take action regulating the use of generative AI in communications around elections, some going as far as to outright ban deepfakes of politicians. At the federal level, there has been, unsurprisingly, little movement. Â Artificial intelligenceDeepfakes Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

What the Hell Is âAgenticâ AI on the new MediaTek Dimensity Flagship Mobile Chip?,Kyle Barr,2024-10-09,"Chipmaker MediaTek is being explicit about what our phonesâ futures will entail. In its best Elmo impression, MediaTek is asking, “Can you say the word âagentic?â What does that mean, exactly? For its newly announced flagship 3nm chip, the Dimensity 9400, the focus is now on how AI assistants can work across apps and even control your phone for you. To break it down, âagenticâ refers to AI agents. Think of those as multiple AI models working in tandem to complete a task. Imagine you put a prompt into an AI chatbot, telling it to call your mother and wish her a happy birthday on your behalf. Various AI models will create the birthday message, look into your contacts for your motherâs number, and then put in the call using an AI-generated voice. Agents are a buzzword among the higher echelons of Silicon Valley, but the term âagenticâ canât leap off the concept sheet and onto our phones without the underlying technology behind it. The Dimensity 9400 is just the first chip officially revealed this year, and it claims it can support agents that are supposed to power the supercharged assistants on our phones. It claims to support 80% better LLM performance than the Dimensity 9300 and twice as good AI art generation with a new neural processor. The other end of that is a so-called âDimensity Agentic AI Engineâ thatâs made to help developers set a work path for various AI-focused apps. Taiwan-based MediaTek claims its chips can do around 50 tokens per second for AI computation. Compare that with the current Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3âs 20 tokens per second, though rumors and leaks suggest Qualcomm will reveal Gen 4 later this month. None of the current leaks, like those onÂ SmartPrixÂ andÂ WCCFTech, show comparisons between both chipsâ NPUs. The Dimensity 9400 is an âAll Big Coreâ design with a single ARM cortex-X925 with a 3.62 GHz clock speed, along with three Cortex-X4 and four Cortex-A720 cores. Itâs supposed to get 35% better single-core and 28% better multi-core performance than the 9300. It supports a 100% increase in the L2 cache and a 50% improvement in the L3 cache compared to the Dimensity 9300. Itâs also supporting a 12-core ARM Immortalis-G925 GPU with better ray tracing support. Otherwise, the new MediaTek chipÂ supports LPDDR5X memory at 10.7 GBps and is supposed to improve power efficiency. Funnily enough, it claims to support âtri-fold smartphones,â of which thereâs currently only theÂ Huawei Mate XTÂ to contend with. For the most part, the Dimensity 9300 and 9300+ were tied to brands you wonât find in the U.S., such as Vivo, Oppo, and Redmi.Â As revealed last month, that CPU now also supports theÂ Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra and S10+.Â But as for other U.S.-based products, the OnePlus Pad 2 eschewed the originalâs Dimensity 9000 chip for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Unless U.S. lawmakersâ attitude to international chipmakers changes sometime soon (it wonât), MediaTekâs chips will still be relatively rare for products in the U.S. But that belies just how all chipmakers, not just those in the U.S., are tuning their chips for our upcoming AI assistants. Googleâs Gemini is already taking root on Android, and Apple Intelligence is set to do a complete makeover of iOS on iPhones over the next few months. The point is, it doesnât matter which brand you buy; youâre going to hear the word âagenticâ a lot more in 2025 and beyond. The real question for 2025 is whether agentic AI will work as advertised. So far, weâve seen AI models perfectly capable of handling intense tasks, but those are often processed off-device. So far, on-device AI is simply offering a more complicated assistant apparatus that’s capable of lying to you. The real challenge will be having this AI capable of reaching across apps and performing tasks without calling your mother to tell her something you’ll need to apologize for later.

"Scarlett Johansson, Kylie Jenner and Taylor Swift Top List of Celebrities Used for AI Scams",Matt Novak,2024-10-08,"You’re probably seen the ridiculous videos on social media. There’s a celebrityâmaybe it’s Sydney Sweeney or Tom Hanksâtalking directly to the camera about some product, but something seems a bit off. Maybe it’s the fact that their mouth doesn’t seem to be moving perfectly in sync with their words or maybe it’s that Hanks is trying to sell some sketchy-looking medication you’ve never heard of. Well, you’re right to be skeptical. Thanks to artificial intelligence technology, celebrities are being used left and right in AI deepfake videos and images for all kinds of scams, hawking products they’ve never actually endorsed. And cybersecurity company McAfee has a new list rounding up the most commonly used celebrity likenesses of the past year. Scarlett Johnasson tops the list, which is particularly interesting given her advocacy against non-consensual AI content. Johnasson said she was approached by OpenAI to provide a voice for their robotic assistant tech, but the actress declined. OpenAI went ahead and made a sound-alike voice for one of the company’s demos but seems to have scrapped the voice after Johansson threatened a lawsuit. Other big names on the list include Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift, and Tom Hanks, among others. Hanks wrote a note on Instagram back in August warning that AI fakes were using his likeness to sell medications. “There are multiple ads over the internet falsely using my name, likeness, and voice promoting miracle cures and wonder drugs,” Hanks wrote. “These ads have been created without my consent, fraudulently and through AI. I have nothing to do with these posts or the products and treatments, or the spokespeople touting these cures.” Hanks went on to explain that he has type-2 diabetes and said, “I ONLY work with my board-certified doctor regarding my treatment,” ending his message with an all-caps warning: “DO NOT BE FOOLED. DO NOT BE SWINDLED. DO NOT LOSE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.” Because ultimately, that’s what it’s all about. Making money by fraudulently piggybacking off the likeness of well-known people. The list from McAfee, with the company’s explanations: The one celebrity who’s not on the list but we at Gizmodo see most often? That would be Elon Musk. We even obtained consumer complaints filed with the FTC earlier this year about crypto scams using Musk’s face. They’re everywhere. The folks at McAfee warn that as AI gets better, it will be harder and harder to tell what is a deepfake and what is the real thing. So people will just need to remain vigilant and try to apply some critical thinking skills whenever a supposed celebrity endorsement pops into their social media feed. âIn a time when celebrity news is part of everyday conversation and accessible with the click of a button, people often prioritize convenience over online safety, clicking on suspicious links promising celebrity content or related goods,” Abhishek Karnik, McAfeeâs Head of Threat Research, said in a statement published online. “But if it sounds too good to be true, itâs worth a second look. With cybercriminals using advanced AI tools to create more convincing scams, the risks are growing, and celebrity names are the perfect bait for curious consumers. Thatâs why people need to stay vigilant and think twice before clicking.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

Nobel Prize Goes to ‘Godfathers of AI’ Who Now Fear Their Work Is Growing Too Powerful,Todd Feathers,2024-10-08,"Two AI researchers, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton, received the Nobel Prize in physics on Monday for their work building artificial neural networks that can memorize information and recognize patterns in ways that mimic the human brain. Their research in the 1980s laid the foundation for the last decadeâs explosive progress in artificial intelligence and todayâs ubiquitous recommendation algorithms and generative AI systems. Both men have since said that progress needs to be constrained for the sake of humanity. In its announcement of the prize, the Nobel committee emphasized how far the field has come since Hopfield published his seminal paper in 1982, in which he described a neural network with fewer than 500 possible parameters. Today, tech companies are churning out generative AI systems with billions and trillions of parameters. The Hopfield network was a collection of 30 interconnected digital nodes that could change their values between 1 and 0 and in doing so be programmed to record patterns that represented the pixels in black and white images. It drew on equations from physics used to describe how atoms in a network affect each othersâ spin in order to calculate how the relationships between the nodes in the network represented the images. In effect, the network could be programmed to create memories of certain images. And when it was fed a new image that was fuzzy or incomplete, it could calculate its way back to the most similar image in its memory. Hinton built on Hopfieldâs work by designing neural networks that could not just remember and recreate patterns, but could be taught to recognize similar patterns in entirely different dataâfor example, the patterns that make one picture of a dog like another but not like a picture of a cat. In 1985 he published a paper introducing this network, named a Boltzmann machine after physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who developed statistical equations for calculating the collective properties of a network composed of many different components. In 2023, Hopfield was one of the most notable signatories on a letter calling for AI companies to pause the development of generative AI systems more powerful than OpenAIâs GPT-4. And Hinton has recently been talking a lot about his concerns that AI is advancing too rapidly for humans to control. Heâs estimated that humans could build an artificial intelligence that exceeds our own intelligence in the next five to 20 years and that âIt’ll figure out ways of manipulating people to do what it wants.â He was one of several big names in the field to sign an open letter this year calling for California Governor Gavin Newsom to enact a law that would have held large tech companies liable for building AI models that caused catastrophic losses of life or property damage. Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill, under pressure from tech companies, including Hintonâs former employers at Google. âIn the next few years we need to figure out if thereâs a way to deal with that threat,â Hinton said in an interview with the Nobel Prize committee following the award announcement. âSo I think itâs very important right now for people to be working on the issue of how will we keep control. We need to put a lot of research effort into it. I think one thing governments can do is force the big companies to spend a lot more of their resources on safety research.â Artificial intelligenceGeoffrey HintonJohn Hopfieldnobel prize Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Douglas Rushkoff Knows He Fucked Up,Matthew Gault,2024-10-04,"Douglas Rushkoff feels responsible. Rushkoff is a Gen-X writer and thinker who was part of the initial wave of tech advocates in the 1990s who sold the world on a future online âI was part of the initial wave of people who said: âCome on in, the waterâs fine,ââ he tells me. Three decades on, the world looks very different. Corporations have woven themselves into the fabric of our daily interactions, supercharged by the internet and social media. Now, it appears that artificial intelligence will help corporations program humanity faster and better than ever before. Rushkoff sees that as an opportunity. âItâs like digital media finally has a character,â Rushkoff says of AI. Over the course of his more than thirty career, Rushkoff has written books that heralded the joys of the internet and warned of the perils of the corporations that sought to control it. In 2010 he wrote a slim volume called Program or Be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age. It was full of practical and meaningful advice for living in a digital world. The commands were simple and easy to understand: donât always be online, donât sell your friends, tell the truth, you can always choose ânone of the above,â live in person, one size does not fit all, be yourself, you are never completely right, and share, don’t steal. Rushkoffâs philosophy and a warning were contained in its final command: program or be programmed. According to Rushkoff, humans should be literate about how machines work and understand that itâs humans who build machines to service them. Not the other way around. Some of that comes down to learning programming languages, or at least how if-then statements work, but itâs bigger than that. âLearn to recognize the biases of the media that theyâre using. Itâs that simple,â he says. The book sold well but, he says, was misunderstood. âWhen the book first came outâ¦it became a âlearn to codeâ thing. It became an argument for STEM,â he says. âWe should know something about how technology works. But [the book] was an argument for liberal arts, for how we think critically about these environments. I donât think anyone quite got that. I donât think anyone got that, that sort of McLuhan-esque demand that we look at digital media as an environment thatâs changing who we are, thatâs changing what it means to be human.â He just published an updated version of the book that includes an extra command thatâs all about AI: âValue the human.â âThe best thing about AI is itâs giving us the ability to finally look and say, âOh, these technologies act on us.â You need to get all the way to the science fiction place of âthereâs an AI in there doing something to meâ to understand that, really, all technologies are doing something to you,” he says. “Theyâre all trying to program you in one way or another.â Rushkoffâs first big book was Cyberia in 1994. It was an early exploration of internet culture that, according to its author, was over by the time it hit the shelves. âAt the end of that book, Wired magazine had just published their first issue,â Rushkoff says. âUntil that point, Mondo 2000 and the psychedelic world had been kind of running internet culture.â There was a dream in the early 1990s of what the internet would be and what it could do for humanity. âInternet culture was so much about the unbridled potential of the collective human imagination. Networked together, what are we going to do?â But Rushkoff also saw the warning signs. Corporations began to circle and they asked a different question entirely. âWhat happens when we migrate the most propagandistic techniques of advertising and marketing and public relations to interactive environments?â Rushkoff says that Gen-X counterculture is partly to blame. âWe in the 90s, rave counter-culture, are largely to blame for not bringing forward the social justice agenda of the 1960s with us,â he says. âA lot of the people I talked to in the rave moment were saying âWe have the agenda of no agenda. All are welcome. Feel this thing and it will unfold naturally.â According to Ruskhoff, the ravers looked at the punk movements of the recent past and found them too political and too reactionary. âWe pushed the government off the net, â¦we didn’t realize, when you get rid of government, you create free reign for business,â he says. âThat deregulation didn’t just mean no censorship of my LSD trades on email, it meant no restrictions on Intel and Amazon and Facebook. So we were politically naive as we went into this, and we did not establish a rigorous set and setting around the development of the internet.â As the internet marched forward, the California culture that helped shape it merged with other weird West Coast ideas and became something new. âSo the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, self-actualization, self-improvement, part of California culture stayed but got married to this kind of libertarian, Ayn Rand capitalist thing,â Rushkoff says. You come forward 25 years and you end up with these dissociated anarcho-capitalists as feudal lords of these landscapes.â One of the unpleasant facts about the internet is that it was made by humans who designed it to act on other humans. When we talk about why YouTube shows us things we donât want to see, we complain about âthe algorithm.â When Facebook feeds us a string of AI slop, we bemoan âour feed.â But the simple truth is that we see all this stuff for a reason: a human being designed it that way. âAI provides a really coherent metaphor for what Iâm talking about. AI doesnât do any of the things that people are afraid of, but AI demonstrates to people that this medium adapts to what youâve done. It changes. It learns you. Youâre in a feedback loop,â Rushkoff says. âSo you have an army of super fast artificial intelligences that have no agenda of their own, but have the agenda of Peter Thiel or Mark Zuckerberg.â This proliferation of AI may supercharge all the things many of us hate about the world we live in now. âIf you get more eyeballs from people by making them anxious, then make them fucking anxious, make them violent, make them hate their neighbors, make them impotent, do whatever you have to,â Rushkoff says. âAnd I feel like people kind of get that now. So the feedback loops I was talking about in 1999 when I was saying, âThis is like advertising, but imagine an advertisement that could iterate based on how you respond.â What happens then? I was saying, âYou’re going to get more extreme versions of yourself.â Which is where we ended up.â He points to Twitter, now X. âLook at the total propaganda environment of Twitter/ X now,â Rushkoff says. â[Elon Musk] owns the thing. He sends you his own messages. He sends you the messages of the people he wants you to see, no matter what stream of conversation youâre in. The ads, the bots, are the worldview that he wants you to have. Itâs hard to be on that platform and not think: âWell, thatâs the world.â Even if Iâm saying something else, the air that Iâm breathing in here is that awful techno-fascist, bullying, mean, troll, cruel.â Rushkoff tells me heâs alarmed by how far this thinking has spread. âEven the progressive left has adopted the programmerâs paradigm of, âHow do we get people to be more aware of the climate? How do I get people to eat better?ââ He says. âOnce youâre talking about âhow do I get people to do something?â Youâre saying, âhow do I program people?ââ âWe adopted that understanding of humans as programmable by our systems rather than our systems being programmable by people,â he says. He hopes that this new edition of Program or Be Programmed will push this paradigm shift forward. He hopes that AI will help them see that a better world is possible and that all of these machines are human inventions and that humans should be at the heart of everything we do. âIf technology really can do all these tasks, all this stuff, if they really do have way more utility value than humans, then do we want to double down on our utility value as our core offering, or do we want to start looking at human values? What do we offer that they canât?â You can find Program Or Be Programmed: Eleven Commands for the AI Future wherever books are sold.

"Meta’s Movie Gen AI Video Generator Is Capable of Making Actual Movies, Music Included",Kyle Barr,2024-10-04,"Metaâs AI journey would inevitably take it into the budding realm of AI video. Now,Â the Mark Zuckerberg-led company hasÂ Movie Gen, yet another video generator capable of making some realistic-ish video from a short text prompt. Meta claims this is as useful for Hollywood as it is for the average Instagrammer, even though its not available to anyone outside Meta. Movie Gen can create audio, making itÂ the most capable deep fake generator weâve seen yet. In a blog post, Meta showed off a few example videos, including a happy baby hippo swimming underwater, somehow floating just below the surface and apparently having no problems holding its breath. Other videos showcase penguins dressed in âVictorianâ outfits with too-short sleeves and skirts to be representative of the time period. There’s another video a woman DJing next to a cheetah who is too distracted by the beat to care about her present danger. Everybodyâs getting in on the AI-generated video space. Already this year, Microsoftâs VASA-1 and OpenAIâs Sora promised ârealisticâ videos generated from simple text prompts. Despite being teased back in February, Sora has yet to see the light of day. Metaâs Movie Gen offers a few more capabilities than the competition, including editing existing video with a text prompt, creating video based on an image, and adding AI-generated sound to the created video. The video editing suite seems especially novel. It works on generated video as well as real-world captures. Meta claims its model âpreserves the original contentâ while adding elements to the footage, whether theyâre backdrops or outfits for the sceneâs main characters. Meta showed how you can also take pictures of people and drop them into generated movies. Meta already has music and sound generation models, but the social media giant displayed a few examples of the 13B parameter audio generator adding sound effects and soundtracks on top of videos. The text input could be as simple as ârustling leaves and snapping twigsâ to add to the generated video of a snake winding along the forest floor. The audio generator is currently limited to 45 seconds, so it wonât score entire movies. At least, it wonât be just yet. And no, sorry, you canât use it yet. Metaâs chief product officer, Chris Cox, wrote on Threads, âWe arenât ready to release this as a product anytime soonâitâs still expensive, and generation time is too long.â     In its whitepaper discussing Movie Gen, Meta said the whole software suite is made up of multiple foundation models. The largest video model the company has is a 30B parameter transformer model with a maximum context length of 73,000 video tokens. The audio generator is a 13B parameter foundation model that can do both video-to-audio and text-to-audio. Itâs hard to compare that to the biggest AI companies’ video generators, especially since OpenAI claims Sora uses âdata called patches, each of which is akin to a token in GPT.â Meta is one of the few major companies that still release data with its new AI tools, a practice that has fallen by the wayside as AI has become excessively commercialized. Despite that, Metaâs whitepaper doesnât offer much of an idea of where it got its training data for Movie Gen. In all likelihood, some part of the data set has come from Facebook usersâ videos. Meta also uses the photos you take with the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses to train its AI models. You canât use Movie Gen yet. Instead, other AI movie generators like RunwayMLâs Gen 3 offer a limited number of tokens to create small clips before you need to start paying. A report by 404 Media earlier this year indicated that Runway trained its AI from thousands of YouTube videos, and like most AI startups, it never asked permission before scraping that content. Meta said it worked closely with filmmakers and video producers when creating this model and will continue doing so as it works on Movie Gen. Reports from earlier this year indicate studios are already cozying up to AI companies. Independent darling A24 has recently worked with VC firms specializing in AI, with some tied to OpenAI. On the flip side, Meta is reportedly in talks with Hollywood stars like Judi Dench and Awkwafina about using their voices for future AI projects.
