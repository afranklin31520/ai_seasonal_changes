0,Artificial intelligence to deep learning: machine intelligence approach for drug discovery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33844136/,"Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure-activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein-protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action."

The DL-based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional time on high-level decision-making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and reimbursements.

This review discusses developments and potential practices regarding the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and the related topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence applications related to the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, journals, search engines, print and social media. Resources were cross-checked to verify the information. Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being conducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider the possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be candidates for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions about moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. Although it is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have moral/ethical status, it has yet to be determined what the exact the characteristics that confer moral/ethical status are or will be."

0,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Anesthesiology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973516/,"Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning. Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated.The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery."

0,Technological machines and artificial intelligence in nursing practice.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37332058/,"This article is a theoretical discourse about technological machines and artificial intelligence, highlighting their effective interactive outcomes in nursing. One significant influence is technological efficiency which positively affects nursing care time, enabling nurses to focus more on their patients as the core of nursing. The article examines the impact of technology and artificial intelligence on nursing practice in this era of rapid technological advancements and technological dependence. Strategic opportunities in nursing are advanced, exemplified by robotics technology and artificial intelligence. A survey of recent literature focused on what is known about the influence of technology, healthcare robotics, and artificial intelligence on nursing in the contexts of industrialization, societal milieu, and human living environments. Efficient, precision-driven machines with artificial intelligence support a technology-centered society in which hospitals and healthcare systems become increasingly technology-dependent, impacting healthcare quality and patient care satisfaction.

0,Artificial intelligence in retina.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076935/,"Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st century ophthalmology."
0,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technology Driven Modern Drug Discovery and Development.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36768346/,"The discovery and advances of medicines may be considered as the ultimate relevant translational science effort that adds to human invulnerability and happiness. But advancing a fresh medication is a quite convoluted, costly, and protracted operation, normally costing USD ~2.6 billion and consuming a mean time span of 12 years. Methods to cut back expenditure and hasten new drug discovery have prompted an arduous and compelling brainstorming exercise in the pharmaceutical industry. The engagement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including the deep-learning (DL) component in particular, has been facilitated by the employment of classified big data, in concert with strikingly reinforced computing prowess and cloud storage, across all fields. AI has energized computer-facilitated drug discovery. An unrestricted espousing of machine learning (ML), especially DL, in many scientific specialties, and the technological refinements in computing hardware and software, in concert with various aspects of the problem, sustain this progress. ML algorithms have been extensively engaged for computer-facilitated drug discovery. DL methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) comprising multiple buried processing layers, have of late seen a resurgence due to their capability to power automatic attribute elicitations from the input data, coupled with their ability to obtain nonlinear input-output pertinencies. Such features of DL methods augment classical ML techniques which bank on human-contrived molecular descriptors. A major part of the early reluctance concerning utility of AI in pharmaceutical discovery has begun to melt, thereby advancing medicinal chemistry. AI, along with modern experimental technical knowledge, is anticipated to invigorate the quest for new and improved pharmaceuticals in an expeditious, economical, and increasingly compelling manner. DL-facilitated methods have just initiated kickstarting for some integral issues in drug discovery. Many technological advances, such as ""message-passing paradigms"", ""spatial-symmetry-preserving networks"", ""hybrid de novo design"", and other ingenious ML exemplars, will definitely come to be pervasively widespread and help dissect many of the biggest, and most intriguing inquiries. Open data allocation and model augmentation will exert a decisive hold during the progress of drug discovery employing AI. This review will address the impending utilizations of AI to refine and bolster the drug discovery operation."

0,"Artificial Intelligence in Primary Health Care: Perceptions, Issues, and Challenges.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022751/,"Background:                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is heralded as an approach that might augment or substitute for the limited processing power of the human brain of primary health care (PHC) professionals. However, there are concerns that AI-mediated decisions may be hard to validate and challenge, or may result in rogue decisions.              Objective:                    To form consensus about perceptions, issues, and challenges of AI in primary care.              Method:                    A three-round Delphi study was conducted. Round 1 explored experts' viewpoints on AI in PHC (n=20). Round 2 rated the appropriateness of statements arising from round one (n=12). The third round was an online panel discussion of findings (n=8) with the members of both the International Medical Informatics Association and the European Federation of Medical Informatics Primary Health Care Informatics Working Groups.              Results:                    PHC and informatics experts reported AI has potential to improve managerial and clinical decisions and processes, and this would be facilitated by common data standards. The respondents did not agree that AI applications should learn and adapt to clinician preferences or behaviour and they did not agree on the extent of AI potential for harm to patients. It was more difficult to assess the impact of AI-based applications on continuity and coordination of care.              Conclusion:                    While the use of AI in medicine should enhance healthcare delivery, we need to ensure meticulous design and evaluation of AI applications. The primary care informatics community needs to be proactive and to guide the ethical and rigorous development of AI applications so that they will be safe and effective."
0,Artificial intelligence in cancer diagnostics and therapy: current perspectives.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975094/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into every sphere of human life including the field of medicine. Detection of cancer might be AI's most altruistic and convoluted challenge to date in the field of medicine. Embedding AI into various aspects of cancer diagnostics would be of immense use in dealing with the tedious, repetitive, time-consuming job of lesion detection, remove opportunities for human error, and cut costs and time. This would be of great value in cancer screening programs. By using AI algorithms, data from digital images from radiology and pathology that are imperceptible to the human eye can be identified (radiomics and pathomics). Correlating radiomics and pathomics with clinico-demographic-therapy-morbidity-mortality profiles will lead to a greater understanding of cancers. Specific imaging phenotypes have been found to be associated with specific gene-determined molecular pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis (radiogenomics). All these developments would not only help to personalize oncologic practice but also lead to the development of new imaging biomarkers. AI algorithms in oncoimaging and oncopathology will broadly have the following uses: cancer screening (detection of lesions), characterization and grading of tumors, and clinical decision-making and prognostication. However, AI cannot be a foolproof panacea nor can it supplant the role of humans. It can however be a powerful and useful complement to human insights and deeper understanding. Multiple issues like standardization, validity, ethics, privacy, finances, legal liability, training, accreditation, etc., need to be overcome before the vast potential of AI in diagnostic oncology can be fully harnessed."
