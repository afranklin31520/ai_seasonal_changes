0,Carriers: act swiftly if you want to save the low-end smartphone,Chris Ziegler,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/30/carriers-act-swiftly-save-low-end-smartphone,"In turn, that leaves low-end devices priced right out of the market altogether. In fact, I'd argue that the obscurity is the one and only reason devices like the Comet have a market right now. So far, American carriers seem reluctant to deal with it, but here's the thing: the answer doesn't simply have to be for low-end smartphones to go away. Not everyone needs an iPhone, an Atrix, or a G2x, but it is the responsibility of the carriers to reward their customers appropriately for choosing cheaper devices upfront. So, for example, if you buy the Comet, you pay nothing upfront and the first $50 worth of service would be covered.","For years, I've been talking about the effects of price pressure on the subsidized smartphone business -- the phenomenon that, when left unchecked, results in too many market segments squeezed into far too narrow of a price range. In turn, that leaves low-end devices priced right out of the market altogether. Of course, smartphones pervade every nook and cranny of your carrier's lineup more completely nowadays than ever before, and I've found that it's leading to some truly strange pricing problems.  That was really driven home for me today when I took a look at the first page of of Android devices on T-Mobile's online store. In the span of just $50, you range all the way from the lowly Comet -- sourced from Huawei with a QVGA display -- up to the relatively powerful, capable, and competent myTouch 4G with HSPA+ and a front-facing cam. Granted, the myTouch is refurbished, but you've still got access to the Optimus T and myTouch 3G for free -- and both of those devices are head and shoulders above the Comet, Charm, CLIQ, or CLIQ XT. Every one of those currently go for $0 on contract. And when you look at the total cost of ownership over the span of a two-year commitment, the difference in cost between a free device and a $50 one is all but meaningless.  It's like your realtor showing you two homes: a one-bedroom shack with a leaky roof for $100,000, or an eight-bedroom mansion with a pool for $110,000, both with the same maintenance costs over time (far-fetched, I know, but stay with me on the analogy). Which would you choose? Even if you had to stretch a little bit, you'd obviously aim for the mansion. And what's especially troubling is that for your average consumer, the difference in quality and capability between a Comet and an Optimus T is far less obvious than the difference between a shack and a mansion at the point of purchase. In fact, I'd argue that the obscurity is the one and only reason devices like the Comet have a market right now.  So far, American carriers seem reluctant to deal with it, but here's the thing: the answer doesn't simply have to be for low-end smartphones to go away. Not everyone needs an iPhone, an Atrix, or a G2x, but it is the responsibility of the carriers to reward their customers appropriately for choosing cheaper devices upfront. That's the place where they're failing. I think there are a couple possible options on the table:  Low-end smartphones could be offered with cheaper, exclusive plans. T-Mobile tried this with the Nokia Nuron, which could be activated with a relatively cheap $10 unlimited data plan typically reserved for dumbphones. Over the course of your contract, the benefits really start to add up -- and I bet that carriers' internal stats support my belief that owners of devices like the Comet use significantly less data than owners of midrange and high-end devices (those in the $100 to $300 range). The downside is that there would be a constant barrage of controversial gray areas about what phones should be eligible for the cheaper plans... and plus, as devices get cheaper over time, you'd need to decide whether to make them eligible midstream. Pretty hairy.  T-Mobile tried this with the Nokia Nuron, which could be activated with a relatively cheap $10 unlimited data plan typically reserved for dumbphones.

Pretty hairy. More creative subsidies. Right now, there seems to be an implicit understanding that the floor is $0 on contract. But why? If the Optimus T is free, I think you can make the argument that the Comet is worth about $-50, so either pay the buyer upfront (say, with a prepaid card) or -- probably the more compelling and manageable option -- offer a bill credit. So, for example, if you buy the Comet, you pay nothing upfront and the first $50 worth of service would be covered. Sprint ran a promotion recently that involved bill credits, so I know for a fact these carriers have the technical capability to manage an option like this.","eligible, lowend, devices, comet, swiftly, carriers, act, range, owners, 50, cheaper, contract, data, smartphone, save",2011-04-30,The Verge

2,Samsung sues Apple for infringing 10 patents: a closerlook,Nilay Patel,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/29/samsung-sues-apple-infringing-10-patents-closer,"Tim Cook said the Apple and Samsung talked about their issues ""for some time"" before Apple went to the courts, so it's likely Samsung's attorneys have been gearing up for litigation for a while now. Samsung mostly spends the introduction and background section of the complaint talking about how awesome it is, but there are a couple interesting tidbits. First, Samsung spent $35 billion on R&D from 2005 to 2010, which contributed to a sizable patent portfolio: 28,700 US patents, 4,551 of which were issued in 2010. Let's look at them in order -- the UMTS / W-CMDA patents come first, and then the UI patents. Look for the big first question with these patents to be focused on whether or not they're essential.","It was more or less inevitable that Samsung would respond to Apple's patent and trademark lawsuit with a lawsuit of its own, and here we are: Sammy filed a complaint in the Northern District of California yesterday, alleging 10 counts of patent infringement against Apple. Seven of the patents are to do with UMTS / W-CDMA 3G cellular communications, and the remaining three cover various UI elements -- we'll step through them in detail below.  One interesting note about Samsung's response: this complaint is a standalone that doesn't include the reply to Apple's lawsuit. It's not required for the reply and countersuit to be bundled up, but it's telling that Samsung was prepared to hit back with four patent lawsuits in four countries within a week of Apple's initial filing. Tim Cook said the Apple and Samsung talked about their issues ""for some time"" before Apple went to the courts, so it's likely Samsung's attorneys have been gearing up for litigation for a while now. (Oddly, it doesn't appear that anyone's actually seen the filings Samsung claims to have made in Korea, Japan, and Germany, so those are still rather mysterious.) The real fireworks will come when Samsung files its reply to Apple's complaint, which should happen sometime soon -- I'd expect the court to then consolidate these two proceedings into one.  Okay, all that said -- grab a copy of the complaint and let's break down what Samsung's claiming in this lawsuit, shall we?  Samsung mostly spends the introduction and background section of the complaint talking about how awesome it is, but there are a couple interesting tidbits. First, Samsung spent $35 billion on R&D from 2005 to 2010, which contributed to a sizable patent portfolio: 28,700 US patents, 4,551 of which were issued in 2010. Oh, and 5,933 of those patents are related to telecommunications. That's about right considering Samsung is the second-largest phone maker in the world, but it also means that Samsung had a sizable selection of potential claims to pick from when formulating this lawsuit -- and it picked just these 10. Let's look at them in order -- the UMTS / W-CMDA patents come first, and then the UI patents.  US Patent #7,675,941, Method and Apparatus for Transmitting/Receiving Packet Data Using Pre-Defined Length Indicator in a Mobile Communication System is very technical patent describing a system to increase mobile network efficiency by using header data more effectively.  US Patent #7,362,867, Apparatus and Method for Generating Scrambling Code in UMTS Mobile Communication System, is another highly-technical UMTS / W-CMDA patent that covers generating unique scrambling codes for downlink transmitters.  U.S. Patent #7,447,516, Method and Apparatus for Data Transmission in a Mobile Telecommunication System Supporting Enhanced Uplink Service, covers using two radio channels to transmit data using a set amount of power.  U.S. Patent #7,200,792, Interleaving Apparatus and Method for Symbol Mapping in an HSDPA Mobile Communication System, is... well, it looks like it's for quickly writing a data stream in a systematic way using something called a ""turbo encoder,"" which sounds awesome.  U.S. Patent #7,386,001, Apparatus and Method for Channel Coding and Multiplexing in CDMA Communication System, covers taking multiple data frames that are received out of order across multiple channels and putting them back together efficiently.  US Patent #7,050,410, Apparatus and Method for Controlling a Demultiplexer and a Multiplexer Used for Rate Matching in a Mobile Communication System, covers a transmitter that encodes an input stream into three interleaved streams that are then broken up into different radio frames.  U.S. Patent #6,928,604 Turbo Encoding/Decoding Device and Method for Processing Frame Data According to QOS, has what is clearly the best name of all the claimed patents. (""Turbo"" definitely needs to come back as a word. Galaxy S Turbo -- think about it, Samsung.) Anyway, this one covers taking data frames of variable sizes and combining them into a ""super frame"" that can then be turbo encoded.  Okay, those are the seven super-wonky UMTS / W-CDMA patents. It's extremely notable that Samsung doesn't indicate whether any of these patents are essential to the UMTS or W-CDMA standards -- if they are, Samsung is bound by its membership in the 3GPP standards body to license them under ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (or FRAND) terms. (That's the fight Apple is in with Nokia, if you'll recall.) If these patents aren't essential to UMTS or W-CDMA -- if they're just improvements on the standard, for instance -- then Samsung has to prove the the iPhone makes use of the patented technologies, which won't be an easy road. Look for the big first question with these patents to be focused on whether or not they're essential.  The next three are UI patents, so they're a little easier to understand.  U.S. Patent #6,292,179, Software Keyboard System Using Trace of Stylus on a Touch Screen and Method for Recognizing Key Code Using the Same, is the first UI patent, covering software keyboard functionality. Interestingly, it specifically requires that the keys be ""pressed by a stylus,"" which makes it an odd choice for inclusion here -- at some point Samsung will undoubtedly have to argue that a user's finger is equivalent to a stylus.  U.S. Patent #7,009,626, Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing, covers displaying a low-resolution image preview while the full-resolution images loads in the background -- think zooming and panning in the iOS Maps app.  U.S. Patent #7,069,055 Mobile Telephone Capable of Displaying World Time and Method for Controlling the Same, is a patent on calculating time in multiple cities based on a reference time signal sent from a remote system and the local time of the device. Yes, seriously.","using, samsung, umts, method, closerlook, mobile, infringing, system, patents, data, covers, patent, apple, sues",2011-04-29,The Verge

Still, through it all, I still love Sony as a brand. You're ""dealing with it,"" sure, but this isn't a new problem (oh, the rich history of PSP jailbreaks! You're never going to win in a straight fight, where you lose if your console gets hacked -- because it will. Chris wants you to reopen flagship Sony Galleries -- specifically, the beautiful one on Chicago's Magnificent Mile.","Let's face it, Sony, you aren't doing much right. You can't keep the PlayStation Network online, which just happens to be your primary gaming and content delivery service. Your multitude of business units still seem to be at odds with one another. You're playing catch up or second fiddle in almost all of your major markets: computers, mobile devices, TVs, video games. What's most troubling is that your best ideas never seem to hit the market soon enough, or with enough polish, to actually move the needle.  Still, through it all, I still love Sony as a brand. It represents to me a tasteful, yet aggressively futuristic aesthetic, paired with the best technology money can buy. Even these days I can still see all those elements in place -- some beautiful hardware design here, some technical daring there, some can't-help-but-love-it world domination aspirations still lurking. So, what can be done to bring all these scattered pieces back together and build some truly great products that befit this storied brand? Well, I have some ideas.  Figure out your console jailbreak problem  First off, you have a big problem right now with security. You're ""dealing with it,"" sure, but this isn't a new problem (oh, the rich history of PSP jailbreaks!), and I don't see what you're doing to fight the core issue. See, you don't just run the risk of hackers hacking and users using those hacks, you dare hackers to hack and dare users to use those hacks. You're never going to win in a straight fight, where you lose if your console gets hacked -- because it will. What has to be done is that you have to separate your services out from the core product. You have to make your services so valuable that people either decide not to hack in fear of losing them (which keeps most potential Xbox 360 hackers in check), and / or your services are separate, secure and distinct enough that even a user of a hacked device still wants to be in your ecosystem (which keeps many iPhone jailbreakers paying for apps).  Oh, and don't even get me started on the removal of Linux from the PS3. It was a slap in the face of users, whether they used it or not. In fact, you should really be going in the other direction. This is an opportunity you have to solve something that Apple hasn't figured out yet: letting users sideload non-blessed applications (and games!) that can take full advantage of your hardware (and even your SDK!) without going through your locked down (Sony-gets-a-commission!) channels. I know that sounds anathema to the concept of a software-subsidized game console model, but it also removes the primary impetus for your hardware to be hacked, allows for greater experimentation from up and coming developers, and gives users a choice they can't really get elsewhere. I think we've seen plenty of proof already that consumers will pay for convenience and curation.  Bring back the Walkman brand  ""Walkman"" is one of the most famous brands in all of consumer electronics. Maybe even the famous brand. I don't know who would win in a fight, iPod or Walkman, but I'd be rooting for Walkman. Anyone older than 25 can still easily remember wanting a Walkman cassette player, and then wanting a Discman CD player. That desire hasn't gone away, you just stopped putting the Walkman brand on anything we wanted. It's so diluted now it's almost unrecognizable. As a culture we've moved toward very specific objects of desire: I don't want an MP3 player, I want an iPod; I don't want an Android phone, I want an Evo 4G; I don't want a tablet, I want an iPad. The Walkman ""line"" doesn't mean anything, the word needs to be centered on one single amazing device that's iterated on every year or twice a year. I don't care if it's a tablet or a phone, but it should probably be one of those. Blow it out. Maybe rest the brand for a year and then explode on the scene with the best product and a huge marketing push. People will take notice.  Also, remember that when it comes to a designing a product (hopefully that product), you have something that very few of your competitors do: decades of design legacy. Use it! At some point, consumers are going to get tired of buying a crappy plastic phone every year and start looking around for something that can last. Phone and tablet internals are already plenty powerful for most people, what they want is something that looks and feels great, works flawlessly, has a long-lasting battery, and makes calls. Succeed at that and they'll want to hold onto the phone for years if actually build them something that can last. Aren't you tired of Apple's recent innovations popping up in the MoMA every few years? Do you want to build a slightly better chunk of plastic than Samsung, or build something whose design will outlast its technical relevance?  Need a little inspiration? Check out some of your triumphs from over the years:  Previous Next              1 / 8 Previous Next              1 / 8      Ship things well  One of your biggest problems is shipping things when you say you'll ship them. It's almost a running joke. ""Oh, Sony said spring? So that means we'll see it in the fall. Hopefully."" Obviously this is a much easier problem to point out than it is to fix, but you need to figure it out. Somewhere there's a disconnect between your ideas (which are usually great) and your execution (which is usually sloppy). Typically your hardware is pretty tight, but your software lags behind, either holding up a launch, or, even worse, making us wish you had held up the launch to iron out the kinks.  It's so painful to see great ideas wasted on poor execution. Take the PSP Go and Xperia Play, for instance. They're both great, forward-looking ideas, in principle. A real gaming console without a removable cartridge or disc! A phone with real buttons that can play real console-style video games! But of course the whole point of these things was that there would be software -- and there wasn't. What's better, a phone that can play some crappy app store games, of which there are thousands, or a phone that can play some great console titles, of which there are ""one"" or ""a few.""  Oh, and while we're on the topic of the Xperia Play: I think you have a great idea with the whole ""PlayStation Certified"" concept. Now let's make sure it's more than a concept, yeah? If this isn't easily accessible and compelling to all the myriad Android manufacturers out there, and new game developers as well, they're going to find some other way to get quality games in the hands of users, and you're going to be worse off than when you started.  A couple personal appeals  Nilay asked me to ask you to build another huge-ass Clié like the PEG-NZ90 and send it to him. And a Vaio UX. Do you have his address? I can get it to you, in case you don't.  I'd like you to restart your robotics program and sell me a Qrio. I guess I'd like an Aibo as well, but we all know the future is humanoids. How does next week sound?  Joanna wants a Mylo phone. With a killer keyboard. I don't really think that's too much to ask.  Chris wants you to reopen flagship Sony Galleries -- specifically, the beautiful one on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. Is there a better way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon than playing with a bunch of Aibos?  Oh, and Ross was wondering if you could revive the Intelligent Qube franchise. He says a quick, smart action-puzzler with 3D visuals is much better positioned these days than it was back in '97.

When held in landscape mode, the right and left edges funnel inwards, and while the aesthetic choice may seem minor, it actually made it easier to hold than the Xoom's boxy, chiseled back. There's also another major design component Acer's got Motorola beat on – unlike the Xoom's power button, which is located on the backside, the Iconia's glowing on / off nub lives on the left edge. Again, it may seem like a small detail, but it makes a world of difference when you want to wake up a tablet immediately and get online. My only complaint about that button is that it and the plastic edge it lives on feels a bit cheap in comparison to the rest of the slab, however, those are really the only parts of the tablet that feel a bit cheap. The silver, brushed aluminum, which covers the back and flows onto the front, doesn't only look classy but gives the entire product a nice rigidity. As I intimated in the introduction, I was a bit worried about the overall quality of the device, but I've really been pleasantly surprised at how sturdy the hardware seems.

It's far from perfect — in one magazine blurb, it replaced every 'w' with two 'v's instead, and it gave up entirely trying to capture this book cover for Jaron Lanier's You Are Not a Gadget — but it's certainly more convenient than trying to thumb the keys. There's a widget that let's you jump immediately into photographing a block of text from the home page, as well as giving you hotkeys for starred docs and creating new documents from scratch.","google, creating, docs, trying, version, camera, letsyou, native, text, widget, app, sort, editing, goes, document, capture",2011-04-27,The Verge

We're also told that the iPhone's propensity to continue updating its location cache even after Location Services are turned off is an iOS bug, as is the sheer size of the location cache -- over a year in some cases. First, the exact relationship between the location cache downloaded to the phone and the phone's current location is still a little unclear. And let's talk about those timestamps -- why does the iPhone append user-specific timestamps to location data? Let's hope we learn the answers to those questions when Apple goes to Congress for questioning on the matter.","Apple just issued its first public statement regarding the iPhone location tracking scandal -- it's a 10-question Q&A that opens directly with ""Apple is not tracking the location of your iPhone."" The company goes on to say that the controversial location data stored on the iPhone is actually a cache of crowd-sourced WiFi and cell tower positioning data that's used to speed up GPS calculations and locate the phone when GPS satellites aren't available. It sounds reasonable -- Apple switched from Skyhook to a proprietary WiFi and cell positioning system in iOS 3.2, and the phone needs to maintain a cache so it can locate itself quickly.  We're also told that the iPhone's propensity to continue updating its location cache even after Location Services are turned off is an iOS bug, as is the sheer size of the location cache -- over a year in some cases. Apple says an iOS update due in ""the next few weeks"" will reduce the size of the on-device cache to just seven days and delete it entirely when Location Services are turned off. The update will also stop backing up the cache to your computer, which will make apps like the now-infamous iPhone Tracker much less useful. Apple also says that the next major iOS release will also encrypt the cache, and that it's currently collecting anonymous traffic data so it can launch an ""improved traffic service in the next couple of years.""  All of this makes perfect sense -- and we certainly applaud Apple's forthright tone and promises to take corrective action -- but we've still got some lingering questions. First, the exact relationship between the location cache downloaded to the phone and the phone's current location is still a little unclear. Apple says the iPhone doesn't track your location, but it certainly appears that the net result of updating a ""database of WiFi hotspots and cell towers around your current location"" with user-specific timestamps comes awfully close to... tracking your location. And let's talk about those timestamps -- why does the iPhone append user-specific timestamps to location data? They're what make this whole thing creepy, after all; a big list of nearby WiFi hotspot and cell tower GPS coordinates that's disconnected from user activity wouldn't have raised any eyebrows. We've got a number of theories -- network troubleshooting, that traffic monitoring system -- but a specific explanation from Apple would go a long way.

According to a lengthy PlayStation blog post from SCEA's Patrick Seybold, the company ""expect to restore some services within a week."" He doesn't specify what services, nor does he guarantee the timeline or provide any details beyond ""an illegal and unauthorized intrusion,"" but hey, it's something.  So that was the kind of good news. Now for the insanely bad.  As Seybold lays it out, the hacker — or ""unauthorized person"" to be specific — managed to obtain pretty much every bit of information you might've given the company, which I'm listing below:  Name  Address (city, state, zip)  Country  Email address  Birthdate  PSN / Qriocity password and login  PSN online ID / handle  Purchase history  Billing address  Password security answers  If you're the sort that reuses login / password combinations, or uses the same security questions and answers across multiple services, you might want to rewrite history and double check the ""forget password"" steps for all your accounts.

Any way you slice it, you're dealing with Sprint's RC Cola to AT&T's Coke and Verizon's Pepsi. Oh, and let's not forget that Sprint -- like T-Mobile today -- pays AT&T and Verizon for a significant percentage of its backhaul. It's not a coincidence that AT&T and Verizon are off in their own playground, just $5 apart, while Sprint and T-Mobile are playing in the sub-$100 space. The FCC can't (or won't) herd these catsAnd again, Nilay's argument is that this can work with appropriate regulation.","Even if Sprint were to go all-out and purchase the next three largest players -- MetroPCS, US Cellular, and Leap Wireless (which markets under the Cricket brand) -- they'd only end up with somewhere around 53.5 percent the subscriber count of AT&T. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that they could get to 60 percent by way of merger divestitures. (Of course, this is all assuming they're able to pony up the cash, stock, and government approvals to make all of these deals happen in a timely fashion before Verizon swoops in and makes something happen.)  Any way you slice it, you're dealing with Sprint's RC Cola to AT&T's Coke and Verizon's Pepsi. That's fine for a carrier that specializes in value customers or rural areas -- dozens of smaller carriers peppered around the country survive on those markets -- but for a generalist like Sprint that wants to play in the same ARPU arena as its much larger competitors, that's a big problem. Already playing from a weakened position, Sprint would be dealing with its worst-ever disadvantages in economies of scale for customer and infrastructure hardware purchases. Oh, and let's not forget that Sprint -- like T-Mobile today -- pays AT&T and Verizon for a significant percentage of its backhaul. Barring major regulation, those backhaul connections certainly aren't going to get any cheaper post-merger.  And that brings me to my point: I believe that a duopoly of this magnitude and of this level of significance to the public well-being can only work in the face of a heavy regulatory hand and constant scrutiny. The chart on the right shows a comparison of unlimited voice, text, and data plan pricing on the four major networks as they stand today (except for AT&T, which doesn't offer unlimited data). It's not a coincidence that AT&T and Verizon are off in their own playground, just $5 apart, while Sprint and T-Mobile are playing in the sub-$100 space. Neither of the larger operators are going to engage in a shareholder-bruising price war simply because the duopoly is getting stronger post-merger. If Verizon believed otherwise, it wouldn't be projecting an attitude of complete ambivalence to the proposal.  The FCC can't (or won't) herd these cats  And again, Nilay's argument is that this can work with appropriate regulation. I don't believe that's possible. The FCC and Congress have a tendency to get mired in inaction on hot-button topics that are accompanied by heavy lobby activity: just look at the $350 and $325 smartphone ETFs that Verizon and AT&T levy, respectively -- well above the $200 that Sprint and T-Mobile charge -- which have gone unregulated despite intense scrutiny and complaints from specific commissioners. Inconsistencies in SIM locking policies and proposed laws surrounding handset exclusives have been waved through Washington for even longer, and we're still miles from making progress. What's more, the FCC's open-ended, almost meaningless language surrounding net neutrality exemptions for wireless broadband suggest to me that the current administration has no intention of taking a hard line on anything.","sprint, usa, unlimited, merger, work, way, today, tmobile, att, wireless, verizon, thats, case",2011-04-26,The Verge

18,"Nintendo pre-announces its Wii followup for 2012, rumors unlikely to get less bizarre",Paul Miller,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/25/nintendo-pre-announces-new-wii,"Apparently the screen can even double as a Wii sensor bar in a pinch. Interesting, but nothing strong enough to take my mind off that 6-inch screen. So, I suppose there are three possibilities right now:There is no 6-inch screen, it was all a lie (or a hilarious mistranslation). It's true you can simulate a Wii sensor bar with just about any willing pair of light sources (I prefer vanilla-scented candles, personally). It's Wii Sensor Bar 2.0.","It's never boring with Nintendo, is it? The company is addressing rumors of an upcoming Wii successor head-on (rumors that have spawned the insane mockup you see above), with a comically short press release stating that the new system will be unveiled in playable form at E3 in June this year, and then ship in 2012. Now, this is a fairly odd format for announcing that you're working on a brand new home console -- a statement that's usually reserved for a big gaming expo -- but Nintendo actually took a similar approach to its 3DS launch (albiet with much less rumoring going into it). Here's Nintendo's release in its entirety:  To whom it may concern: Re: Wii's successor system Nintendo Co., Ltd. has decided to launch in 2012 a system to succeed Wii, which the company has sold 86.01 million units on a consolidated shipment basis between its launch in 2006 and the end of March 2011. We will show a playable model of the new system and announce more specifications at the E3 Expo, which will be held June 7-9, 2011, in Los Angeles. Sales of this new system have not been included in the financial forecasts announced today for the fiscal term ending March 2012.  Odd, yes, but rather refreshing for Nintendo to just cop to its plans, instead of letting the rumors go wild for a couple months. Not that they weren't already pretty wild...  But let's start from the start. In its initial report on an ""HD"" Nintendo home console a couple weeks ago, Game Informer quoted a source who said ""Nintendo is doing this one right."" The Wii survived on a strong gimmick and some amazing first party titles, but it suffered in the long term due to its last-gen graphics and an unfruitful relationship with third parties. From the sound of it, Nintendo is attacking both of those problems, and it's sharing some pretty spectacular tech specs with prospective third parties to garner interest and support -- which have apparently been passed along into the gaming press.  Rumors were spot on about the console being announced by E3 this summer, and the word on the street was that the machine would land late this year or early next. Nintendo's ""2012"" narrows it down a little bit, but consoles usually launch in the fall, so we'll see about those ""early 2012"" predictions. Game Informer's initial report also seems to imply that this console will be perfectly capable of running ports of multi-platform mega hits that are currently burning up the charts for the PS3 and Xbox. So, that all sounds great. Good job, Game Informer, you get a gold star.  Things got a little crazy the next day, however. French site 01.net put forward some rumors on tech specs, including a three-core IBM PowerPC processor, ATI R700 GPU, and at least 512MB of RAM. They also mentioned an unspectacular ""Project Cafe"" codename for the new console. But then they shot for the moon with mention of a 6-inch touchscreen tablet controller, which has a camera, d-pad, bumpers and triggers along for the ride. Apparently the screen can even double as a Wii sensor bar in a pinch.  Now, I'd love to write this all off as the insane rantings of a little-known foreign site, but 01.net nailed the NGP before Sony's announce, and its report has been since ""confirmed"" by a multitude of outlets, including IGN.  IGN followed this all up yesterday with some more specifics on the spec front, including an assertion that the console will outstrip the PS3 and Xbox 360 in sheer horsepower. This won't be so notable when the PS4 and Xbox 720 inevitably leapfrog ahead in a couple years, but in the near term this could be a huge selling point for Nintendo -- especially if they can master the 1080p and 3D gaming that the modern consoles more or less choke on with the current blockbuster titles.  Interesting, but nothing strong enough to take my mind off that 6-inch screen. Basically, from where I'm sitting, there's no way Nintendo can sell controllers with embedded 6-inch touchscreens for anything less than $150 (maybe $100, at a stretch). Sure, Nintendo got away with a $99 peripheral with the Wii Fit, but you only need one of those per home. Theoretically Nintendo is going to want more than one person at a time playing on this new console -- how else are we going to play Smash Bros.?  So, I suppose there are three possibilities right now:  There is no 6-inch screen, it was all a lie (or a hilarious mistranslation). There is a 6-inch screen on the console itself, or somehow separate from the primary controllers. There is a 6-inch screen on the controllers.  Let's talk these through. I think a screen of some sort actually makes a lot of sense, given Nintendo's penchant for gimmicks and the purported camera on the controller. The camera on the controller makes even more sense, because it would actually allow for some really fine-tuned motion control (think of how the PlayStation Move works, but in reverse), but it also allows for great augmented reality possibilities when used in tandem with a screen -- as shown on the Nintendo 3DS.  In fact, the Nintendo 3DS already has all the makings of an excellent motion controller for a console. It has all sorts of cameras, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a touchscreen, and an analog nub. When you add up its two screens, it has about six inches of pixel real estate as well. (That is, if super flat aspect ratios are your thing. In total the 3DS screen area adds up to about half of a 6-inch diagonal display). Unfortunately, that $250 pricetag seems to demonstrate exactly how difficult a controller with a 6-inch display would be to pull off.  Now, the biggest red flag in all of this is 01.net's claim that you can use the screen of the controller as a Wii sensor bar. It's true you can simulate a Wii sensor bar with just about any willing pair of light sources (I prefer vanilla-scented candles, personally). Unfortunately, those light sources have to be almost a foot apart to really get a Wii-like experience. Even if you squash the aspect ratio of a 6-inch diagonal screen to flat, it's still not likely to be wide enough for good Wii gameplay.  However -- and stick with me here, I'm about to talk some crazy talk -- if you imagine the 6-inch screen as a different kind of sensor bar, it could make sense. Imagine a screen built into a console, or one that's external to the console but not a controller. It would be the perfect way to offer up an image that can be tracked by a camera. Think of those augmented reality cards that Nintendo ships with the 3DS, but on a larger and more dynamic scale -- and one that works under any lighting conditions. In fact, it wouldn't even have to be a full-on LCD screen, merely something that can light up and offer a fairly detailed and distinct pattern. It's Wii Sensor Bar 2.0.  Only problem with that theory (outside of its general silliness) is that there's a lot of noise around this console being able to stream entire games, or at least a view of a game, to the 6-inch screen. Which brings us right back to where we started. Maybe Player 1 gets a big touchscreen, but everybody else can play along with a regular controller? Maybe Nintendo found a stack of 6-inch LCDs that fell off the back of a truck? Maybe Nintendo expects us all to be incredibly wealthy by the end of the year? Who really knows.  Another thing to keep in mind is that Nintendo actually considered a touchscreen experience for its Wii controller (codenamed Revolution at the time) to jump off of the innovative gameplay allowed by the then-new DS, but ultimately decided it needed to differentiate its home console experience from its mobile experience. With only two primary products, a home console and a mobile console, can Nintendo afford to confuse the two? Or obviate the need for one of them?  The good news is that with Nintendo putting its official stamp on things, these loose-lipped developers might find even more of an excuse to talk. There's certainly still a lot to learn and understand about Nintendo's much-anticipated console sequel. We'll be listening! What is clear is that the time for an HD followup to the Wii is all of a sudden very nearly at hand, and that makes me happy. Shenanigans are just gravy.

19,Exclusive: Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet with Honeycomb and an optional stylus to hit this summer,Joanna Stern,https://www.theverge.com/google/2011/4/24/2514882/lenovo-thinkpad-tablet-honeycomb-optional-stylus-hit-summer,"No, this isn't a Windows 7 convertible like you’d expect — this is a full-fledged Android 3.0 slate complete with an optional pen and an accompanying ""keyboard portfolio case."" It sounds killer and we’ve got all the details on what's shaping up to be the most interesting Android 3.0 tablet we've seen yet — hit the break for full details! Surrounding the .55-inch thin tablet, Lenovo’s got USB 2.0, Micro USB, and mini-HDMI ports as well as a full-sized SD card slot. As the image above shows, Lenovo’s crafted it’s own Android 3.0 skin, or what it seems to be calling the Lenovo Family UI. Something tells us this was a mistake on Lenovo's part, considering there was no such thing as Android 3.0 two years ago.","Ready for one awesome Easter present? Well, it appears that Lenovo's having a rough time keeping a lid on its new products this weekend, and we just got a hold of a juicy PowerPoint that reveals a new ThinkPad tablet for ""on-the-go professionals."" No, this isn't a Windows 7 convertible like you’d expect — this is a full-fledged Android 3.0 slate complete with an optional pen and an accompanying ""keyboard portfolio case."" It’s also going to have an IPS display and a dual-core Tegra 2 processor. It sounds killer and we’ve got all the details on what's shaping up to be the most interesting Android 3.0 tablet we've seen yet — hit the break for full details!  Hardware specs  Like the rest of the Honeycomb tablets, the ThinkPad Tablet or Think Slate — it seems to go by both monikers in the slides — will be powered by an NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor, sports front and rear cameras, and will be available with 16, 32, and 64GB storage options. But more interesting is what’s on the exterior of this 1.6-pound slab: it will have a 10.1-inch, 1280 x 800 IPS capacitive display with a ""true pen"" option for ""sketching and note-taking."" The latter sounds a lot like what HTC’s got going on with its Flyer, which certainly makes sense considering N-Trig (the maker of the touchscreen) has promised multiple pen-equipped Android tablets this year. Surrounding the .55-inch thin tablet, Lenovo’s got USB 2.0, Micro USB, and mini-HDMI ports as well as a full-sized SD card slot. Throw in the 3G and 4G connectivity options that are mentioned and we’re pretty much sold on this thing being the mother of Honeycomb tablets.  There aren’t many details on the keyboard, but from the picture it looks like it’s got a touchpad, and if we know Lenovo, the deck and keys will be some of the most comfortable out there.  Software  It’s not really enough to say the ThinkPad Tablet runs Honeycomb since it appears that lots of effort has gone into the interface and software that Lenovo’s been cooking up. As the image above shows, Lenovo’s crafted it’s own Android 3.0 skin, or what it seems to be calling the Lenovo Family UI. It looks a lot like the Skylight interface that we’ve seen before on the consumer-aimed Le Pad, but on top of that Lenovo’s heavily emphasizing business features and security software with this tablet. Promising ""seamless integration with your existing IT infrastructure,"" it will support Cisco’s enterprise software and will be offered with Symantec, McAfee, Computrace, and a slew of other security apps. If you’re interested in how Lenovo’s targeting this for business deployment, you’ll want to check out the slides below. For what it's worth, our source tells us that Lenovo's been spending lots of time getting the software just right and that these slides are a few months old, which means the interface may change by the time it hits the market.  Pricing and availability  So when is this thing coming, and how much is it going to suck out of your wallet? That’s a good question. Our source had told us that this was slated for an earlier release but that it was pushed for software development. According to the document, it's targeted for an August launch, but there are also a few mentions of July. Something tells us this thing will definitely be out by September since there’s no doubt that it makes an interesting back-to-school gadget. As for pricing, our source also told us it was designed to be competitive with the iPad and the document lists it at $499. We’re assuming the active digitizer option and keyboard portfolio will be competitively priced add-ons. That’s all we’ve got for now, but don’t you doubt it -- we’ll be keeping our eyes and ears open about what’s looking to be the most feature-packed Honeycomb tablet yet.  Update: Ah yes, some have noticed that a handful of slides are marked 2009. Something tells us this was a mistake on Lenovo's part, considering there was no such thing as Android 3.0 two years ago. Again, as we previously stated, these slides are a few months old, but we have heard that this product is very much still in the works.

20,Is this what the iPhone 5 will look like? (updated),Joshua Topolsky,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/22/iphone-5-design,"While the current crop of chatter on the internet suggests the iPhone 5 will be little more than a spec bump to the iPhone 4, that's not the story we've been hearing at all. In fact, the device could look something a little more like the image above -- an image which is our rendering based on information from a variety of sources. Our sources say the new model (or at least one of the new designs in testing) looks ""more like the iPod touch than the iPhone 4."" Another interesting note about this phone: this week the tech community has been abuzz over comments Verizon's CFO Fran Shammo made in reference to the next Apple phone. We're working on a couple of other intriguing pieces of information concerning future Apple products... so stay tuned for much, much more.","There's no shortage of rumors swirling about the iPhone 5 right now, but we've got some enlightening information (and an image) that might help paint a better picture of what Apple's next play in the mobile market could be. While the current crop of chatter on the internet suggests the iPhone 5 will be little more than a spec bump to the iPhone 4, that's not the story we've been hearing at all. In fact, the device could look something a little more like the image above -- an image which is our rendering based on information from a variety of sources.  Note: Yes, folks, that's our mockup -- not a real device.  For starters -- as I reported back in January on Engadget -- the design of the phone is set to radically change (""a completely redesigned handset""). Our sources say the new model (or at least one of the new designs in testing) looks ""more like the iPod touch than the iPhone 4."" The phone will be thinner than the iPhone 4, and may have a ""teardrop"" shape which goes from thick to thin (something along the lines of the MacBook Air profile).  In a sketch supplied to us by a source (on which the image above is based), the home button is doing double duty as a gesture area; this falls in line with testing we've seen for gestures on the iPad, and our sources say that gestures are definitely coming in a future version of iOS. The home button will likely be enlarged, but not scrapped altogether. Furthermore, we're hearing that the screen on the device will occupy the entire (or near to it) front of the phone, meaning almost no bezel. Our source says the company is doing very ""interesting things"" with bonded glass technology, and has been exploring designs where the earpiece and sensors are somehow behind the screen itself, making for a device where the display is actually edge-to-edge. Regardless, the sketch we've seen suggests the screen will go up to 3.7-inches while keeping the current resolution, and at that size, pixel density goes from 326 to 312 (a drop of 13ppi). That means that Apple can still tout Retina Display technology (the claim is that anything above 300ppi means the pixels aren't distinguishable at 12 inches). Rumors have been suggesting that the size would bump up to 4 inches, but at that size with the current resolution, pixel density drops to 288, making it harder for Apple to use the RD branding.  While the art we've seen shows some form of inductive or touch charging, our sources can't confirm whether or not Apple's working on its own version of cable-free juicing. There's also a ""swipe area"" shown in the drawing which appears to be on the bottom and / or top of the device -- that could very well be an NFC point, but that's pure speculation on our part.  Another interesting note about this phone: this week the tech community has been abuzz over comments Verizon's CFO Fran Shammo made in reference to the next Apple phone. While answering an analyst question over changes in the company's margins, Shammo stated:  ""The fluctuation, I believe, will come when a new device from Apple is launched, whenever that may be, and that we will be, on the first time, on equal footing with our competitors on a new phone hitting the market, which will also be a global device.""  This information falls perfectly in line with news I outlined in that same Engadget post, meaning that this next phone could be the first to really utilize Qualcomm's dual GSM / CDMA Gobi chipset (the Verizon iPhone 4 has the MDM6600 inside, but does not work in both modes). That would be a smart play for Apple, since the company has just made huge inroads into the Chinese market, and a world phone that did double duty would mean a simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) release.  Now, keep in mind that this info isn't fact -- we're getting lots of threads from lots of places and trying to make sense of the noise. The versions of devices our sources are seeing could be design prototypes and not production-ready phones. Still, there are strong indications that Apple will surprise a public that's expecting a bump more along the lines of the 3G to 3GS -- and this is some insight into where those designs might be headed. We're working on a couple of other intriguing pieces of information concerning future Apple products... so stay tuned for much, much more.  Update: One quick note worth pointing out -- the taper is probably a little exaggerated in the mockup (that's thanks to our so-so Photoshopping skills), and we're not saying the backing will be metal, like the iPod touch. That's simply the basis for this image.","sources, touch, iphone, phone, updated, information, look, image, weve, device, thats, apple",2011-04-22,The Verge
21,Verizon 4G LTE mobile hotspot review: Novatel MiFi 4510L vs. Samsung SCH-LC11,Joanna Stern,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/22/verizon-4g-lte-samsung-novatel-mifi-review,"As you may recall, back on the first ""This is my next Podcast"" Nilay and Josh got all giddy about running out and buying Verizon's first LTE mobile hotspot -- the Samsung 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot (or the SCH-LC11). The SCH-LC11 has a more minimalist look to it, with an all-black, soft-touch plastic shell and row of colorful LEDs, while the Novatel MiFi plays it with a more classic aesthetic and chrome border. Sadly, the Verizon Novatel isn't clad in a brushed grey plastic like the Sprint WiMAX version; instead, it gets a glossy black plastic exterior, which picks up loads of fingerprints. However, while the process is simple, I did find that the Novatel took slightly longer than the Samsung to boot and acquire a 4G signal. It would have been handy if 3G / 4G signs were provided on the display, but regardless, the E Ink indicators are extremely helpful.","As you may recall, back on the first ""This is my next Podcast"" Nilay and Josh got all giddy about running out and buying Verizon's first LTE mobile hotspot -- the Samsung 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot (or the SCH-LC11). Well, it turns out neither of them ever made it to the Verizon store -- they got preoccupied with writing a slew of reviews and explanatory articles -- but that's actually been a blessing in disguise since just this week Verizon released the Novatel 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot MiFi 4510L. Sure, both of the products are virtually the same -- you shell out $100 (after a $50 mail-in rebate) and sign up for a two-year contract and you get a gadget that lets you connect up to five devices to Verizon's blazing fast LTE network -- but there are some intrinsic differences, which ultimately make one better than the other. So, which one is the This is My Next team buying? Read on below as I put them through five ferocious rounds!  Round 1: Design  Personal hotspots have never been the most stunning gadgets on the block, but that's because they really don't have to be -- they're unassuming and hide in your bag or pocket. The Samsung and Novatel are really no different in that regard, but they're not devices you'd be embarrassed to leave out next to your frothy latte or turkey sandwich. The SCH-LC11 has a more minimalist look to it, with an all-black, soft-touch plastic shell and row of colorful LEDs, while the Novatel MiFi plays it with a more classic aesthetic and chrome border. Sadly, the Verizon Novatel isn't clad in a brushed grey plastic like the Sprint WiMAX version; instead, it gets a glossy black plastic exterior, which picks up loads of fingerprints. The E Ink display on the front of the device is obviously its killer feature, but more on that soon.  Sure, you're probably not going to buy one of these based on looks alone, but the size and weight of them could certainly be a factor. The 3.5 x 2.3 x .45-inch thick Samsung weighs just three ounces, and takes the prize for being the thinner of the two; the Novatel weighs a similar three ounces, though measures .53-inches thick. That difference in height isn’t huge, but the Samsung definitely laid more comfortably in my skinny jeans. Both devices have Micro USB ports for charging, but unfortunately, neither of them have microSD card slots, like the Sprint version, for sharing files.  Winner: Samsung. Its thinner body and cleaner aesthetic put the SCH-LC11 ahead in this round. Although, I should note that our resident mobile expert Chris ""Fashionista"" Ziegler prefers the look of the Novatel.  Round 2: Setup / connection speed  Both of these hotspots are insanely easy to set up. Press the power button, find the SSID in your network manager, punch in the pre-assigned password, and you’ve got LTE! (Well, if you’re in one of Verizon’s coverage spots.) However, while the process is simple, I did find that the Novatel took slightly longer than the Samsung to boot and acquire a 4G signal. The Novatel took an average of 45 seconds while the Samsung about 33 -- not a huge difference, but for us, those seconds are important when breaking news on the road.  You can change the settings in your browser while connected. Both the Samsung and Novatel interfaces allow you to change the password, SSID name, and a host of other details. You'll log into the Samsung more often since it's the only location you can see the battery life and signal strength, but we’ll be getting to that in a moment.  Winner: Tie! The Samsung may boot slightly faster, but both of these are really identical when it comes to setup and configuration.  Round 3: Signal and battery indicators  It's in this round where these two differ the most, and while indicators may seem like small potatoes, they're far from it on this sort of device. Believe me, when you're liveblogging an event, you want to know how much battery you've got left and what the signal is like as quickly as possible, and Samsung makes telling those things extremely difficult. The LED power button and three additional indicators on the front of the device -- there's one for 4G, 3G, and WiFi broadcasting -- require you to memorize a slew of color combinations. For instance, if the 4G or 3G signal is strong the respective LEDs maintain a green light, while if it's weak, it will turn a yellowish green. Roaming on either of those? You get a blinking green and yellow light. It's the same sort of deal with the battery indicator. If your battery is low, the power button will turn yellow and then finally red when you’re getting into the five percent danger zone. In all seriousness, I'm not sure why this thing didn't ship with a color wheel on the back cover -- although to Verizon or Samsung’s credit, there’s a handy chart in the user manual. As I previously mentioned, the only way to get specifics about the signal strength or battery is to log into the web settings portal.  Sure, I got used to knowing what each color meant, but the Novatel's E Ink screen prevented me from having to exert that sort of brain power. The display has a series of indicators, including a more precise battery meter, which indicates how much juice is left with a range of four bars, and a signal strength meter. The signal indicator is particularly useful -- I didn’t have to boot up my computer to tell if there was a decent 4G signal in the back of my local coffee shop. However, the Novatel still relies on an LED light on the edge to tell you what network it's connected to -- a solid green light means you're rolling on LTE, the violet means 3G. It would have been handy if 3G / 4G signs were provided on the display, but regardless, the E Ink indicators are extremely helpful. My only issue with the display is that it’s hard to see in dim environments -- this could be a potential issue at romantically lit press events.  Winner: Novatel. There's no question about it, the MiFi 4510L takes the cake here with its E Ink display and easily glanceable indicators.  Round 4: Speeds  In this category the two were pretty much neck and neck. In my testing around New York City, the two provided incredibly fast speeds. On Speedtest.net, both the devices averaged between 14 and 17Mbps on the downlink and around 5Mbps on the uplink. Below is a more detailed comparisons, but I can confidently say, that LTE is faster than my insanely crappy home Time Warner Cable connection. (Note: my apartment connection is really, really slow!)  However, like some others out there, I noticed that the Samsung would lose connectivity periodically, even though the device indicated that the signal was strong. Verizon's looking into what looks like some sort of signal stalling, but I’m still seeing the issue on my review unit.  In addition to LTE, both pack 1xRTT and EV-DO to fall back on when the speedier network is unavailable. I actually only fell back on 3G once while using the Samsung in the last week (thankfully, LTE is fairly ubiquitous in midtown Manhattan), and while the transition between networks was smooth, my one complaint with the Samsung is that there's no manual way to switch between the radios to either save battery life or just force one network instead of another. The Novatel allows you to do that in its web portal.  Winner: Novatel. Even though the wireless LTE speeds are roughly the same here, Novatel takes another round with its steady connection and ability to manually switch between networks.  Round 5: Battery life / heat  Both devices pack 1500mAh, 5.6Wh batteries, which makes their runtime almost exactly the same. When connected to the HP Pavilion dm1z, the Novatel lasted two hours and 57 minutes while looping a movie on Hulu. Connected to the same laptop, the Samsung lasted three hours and five minutes. Both times are pretty shoddy compared to 3G hotspots, which typically run closer to five hours, and while you can pick up spare batteries and swap 'em out, you'll probably be more inclined to carry the charging cable around. (Samsung will apparently offer an extended battery for about $50.) Speaking of cables, both can be used while being charged through a wall outlet; however, while the Samsung will let you connect while charging via a laptop, the Novatel doesn't have that feature just yet. Verizon promises an update for the latter very soon.  My biggest question about these hotspots was actually heat. I know, it seems like an odd thing to worry about, but my MiFi 2200 gets incredibly warm during heavy use -- it’s gotten to the point where it’s uncomfortable to keep in a pocket at trade shows. The good news is that neither of these devices get that hot, they can get warm, but it's not going to double as a hand warmer.  Winner: Tie! The battery life on both of these isn’t great, but at least you can use them both while charging them up.  Overall winner: Novatel  They say everything happens for a reason, and I’m going to say there was just some larger force that kept Nilay and Josh from snatching up the Samsung Mobile Hotspot a few weeks ago. While the Samsung took the design round and tied with the Novatel in setup and battery life, the Novatel MiFi is clearly the stronger mobile LTE option with its clearer status indicators, constant LTE signal, and ability to manual switch between 3G and 4G networks. The Samsung may be thinner, slightly more attractive, and have the ability to broadcast a signal when plugged into a laptop, but it's pretty much a no-brainer -- once my colleagues take a break from writing and podcasting, we're all taking a field trip to Verizon to get ourselves a few Novatel MiFi LTE 4510Ls.  Novatel Verizon Wireless 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot MiFi 4510L  Good Stuff  E Ink display with status indicators  Really fast LTE speeds  Can manually switch between 3G and LTE networks  Bad Stuff  Can't broadcast signal while charging via USB  Slower to get online than the Samsung  Verge Score  8.0 Verge Score  Samsung 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot SCH-LC11  Good Stuff  Very fast LTE speeds  Broadcasts signal while charging via USB  Attractive design  Bad Stuff  No detailed status indicators  Battery life could be better  Verge Score","samsung, schlc11, lte, 4g, mobile, battery, hotspot, 3g, vs, verizon, mifi, review, novatel, signal",2011-04-22,The Verge

24,AT&T files T-Mobile merger documentation with the FCC --the highlights,Chris Ziegler,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/21/att-files-t-mobile-merger-documentation-fcc,"AT&T formally kicked off the T-Mobile merger process today by filing its first supporting documents with the FCC. Broader deployment of LTE, using T-Mobile's AWS spectrum (AT&T is already using both AWS and 700MHz bands to build out its LTE services). Oh, and T-Mobile has spectrum licenses across the country, which makes it easier for AT&T to build out their network. AT&T is also insistent that T-Mobile is not a real competitor -- after all, if T-Mo isn't real competition, than the merger won't affect the market. and The hits don't stop there, though -- AT&T says that T-Mobile doesn't have a ""particularly compelling portfolio of smartphone offerings.""","AT&T formally kicked off the T-Mobile merger process today by filing its first supporting documents with the FCC. At 381 pages, it's a monster -- it lays out AT&T's groundwork for the merger, argues that it will actually help competitiveness in the wireless industry, and promises that rural customers will ultimately be better served. In other words, everything AT&T's said all along.  We've broken down the document with some light analysis after the break, so you should definitely grab the PDF and follow along -- one way or another, this transaction is going to fundamentally change the US mobile market, and it's critical to understand all the angles.  Introduction, or how America is addicted to data  The gist of the entire merger is AT&T's claim that this is the quickest path to relief of the country's explosive growth in data consumption over the past several years -- growth that is expected to continue unabated for years to come. Unfortunately, they weren't shy redacting the public version of the filing, so a lot of the juiciest info is missing, but there's still some revealing data to be found:  AT&T opens by saying it ""faces network spectrum and capacity constraints more severe than those of any other wireless provider, and this merger provides by far the surest, fastest, and most efficient solution to that challenge.""  It expects to generate $39 billion in ""cost savings and other synergies"" from the merger over time, starting with $3 billion in year three post-merger. Those savings are expected to come from a few sources, including a reduction in interconnect costs on the T-Mobile side (by switching to AT&T backhaul where possible), ""optimized"" retail and distribution, and a greater economy of scale for handset and infrastructure contracts.  from the merger over time, starting with $3 billion in year three post-merger. Those savings are expected to come from a few sources, including a reduction in interconnect costs on the T-Mobile side (by switching to AT&T backhaul where possible), ""optimized"" retail and distribution, and a greater economy of scale for handset and infrastructure contracts. There's no question that LTE is a major focus of AT&T's arguments in favor of the merger -- the company continues to promise that the merger will allow it to hit 97 percent of Americans with LTE, or about 55 million more people than it had been previously planning for. That focus on connecting everyone comes up a lot -- AT&T clearly thinks that playing to the Obama Administration's broadband initiatives will help it win approval.  AT&T's data volumes went up 8000 percent from 2007 to 2010, and they don't expect the curve to level off -- in fact, AT&T says it projects to do all of 2010's mobile data traffic in just the first five to seven weeks of 2015 .  . WiFi hotspots (and ""Hotzones"" like Times Square) have been a key part of AT&T's plan to alleviate network congestion -- particularly in ultra-dense areas -- but they say their ""experience is that Wi-Fi provides less meaningful capacity relief than a cell site.""  How AT&T thinks T-Mobile can help  AT&T says that it expects to have insufficient capacity to handle traffic or build out LTE in a variety of cities at some point in the future, but -- as before -- all of the details are redacted. Thanks a lot, AT&T. (We'd also point out that AT&T is already sitting on massive caches of 700MHz and AWS spectrum and will be getting more through its Qualcomm deal, so this is a pretty tricky part of the case to build.)  AT&T's main argument is relatively simple: although a merger with T-Mobile won't create any more spectrum -- rather, combining the two company's spectrum holdings will enable all of it to be used more efficiently and ultimately serve more people. This is broken up into a number of sub-arguments:  Efficiencies from combining T-Mobile's cell sites into AT&T's network, a process that will begin ""immediately"" after the deal is approved, yield results in nine months, and be completed in two years.  The combined company will ""eliminate redundant control channels and promptly free up 4.8 to 10 MHz of extra spectrum, depending on the market.""  The company talks up the potential for ""channel pooling efficiencies,"" which is a fancy way of saying that users of both networks will have access to each others' resources instead of being arbitrarily split into two buckets that can't spill over into the other during busy periods. AT&T uses ticket agent lines at an airport to illustrate the point: one line with four agents can serve people more efficiently than two lines with two agents at opposite ends of the airport, since the lines will almost certainly be different lengths.  Utilization efficiencies from making better use of ""spare"" capacity in places where the networks are underutilized.    Broader deployment of LTE, using T-Mobile's AWS spectrum (AT&T is already using both AWS and 700MHz bands to build out its LTE services). This basically means that T-Mobile's ""4G"" HSPA network will be shut down and replaced by LTE over time, which we were all mostly expecting anyway. Oh, and T-Mobile has spectrum licenses across the country, which makes it easier for AT&T to build out their network.  In talking about LTE coverage, Rick Moore, AT&T's SVP of Corporate Development, notes that the company's ""senior management concluded that an 80% build was the limit [their] company could justify to [their] shareholders"" -- in other words, the merger is the only way the suits were going to give the thumbs-up to the 97 percent figure they're talking about now.  -- in other words, the merger is the only way the suits were going to give the thumbs-up to the 97 percent figure they're talking about now. Worried that the integration might not go smoothly? ""Cingular’s acquisition of AT&T Wireless in 2004 is a prime example of our ability to execute on synergy plans. Within two years of the AT&T Wireless acquisition, most of the integration work was complete and merger synergies were being realized.""  ""In short, this transaction is the most pro-consumer solution to the critical capacity challenges facing these two companies. It is also the most pro-innovation and pro-investment solution for America."" It is not clear whether hard copies of the filings come with miniature American flags, but they should.  In the ""sum is greater than the parts"" department, AT&T also talks up its COWs -- mobile cell sites that can be deployed to disaster areas or to temporary crowds where service is suffering -- as an example of its emergency preparedness, specifically citing its response to Hurricane Ike in 2008. Likewise, it praises T-Mobile's response to Katrina in 2005, saying the pair's ""combined emergency-preparedness initiatives will provide customers with more robust disaster recovery capabilities than they would receive in the absence of this transaction.""  AT&T assesses the 'competition'  Oh, but don't worry -- AT&T will still have major competition in the market! This might be funniest part of the filing, because in addition to calling out Verizon as a strong future competitor, AT&T also has to big-up vastly smaller players like Sprint and MetroPCS. Let's walk through them.  Verizon is AT&T's ""closest competitor,"" and ""occupies an exceptionally strong position in all market segments, and it claims unequaled network advantages in the provision of high-end LTE services over its nationwide 22 MHz block of 700 MHz spectrum."" AT&T also says Verizon has outspent it on advertising in three of the last four years.  is AT&T's ""closest competitor,"" and ""occupies an exceptionally strong position in all market segments, and it claims unequaled network advantages in the provision of high-end LTE services over its nationwide 22 MHz block of 700 MHz spectrum."" AT&T also says Verizon has outspent it on advertising in three of the last four years. Sprint is described as a ""tough, significant, and resurgent competitor,"" AT&T notes, has ""reversed its earlier setbacks"" and is in the midst of a multi-billion dollar network upgrade -- and AT&T concludes that ""Sprint appears to have delivered on its network performance promises to customers."" This is probably just about the only time you're going to hear AT&T laud Sprint's ""substantial 4G success,"" praise the Evo 4G as ""highly successful,"" and call Sprint's spectrum position ""exceptional"" and ""far stronger than AT&T's.""  is described as a ""tough, significant, and resurgent competitor,"" AT&T notes, has ""reversed its earlier setbacks"" and is in the midst of a multi-billion dollar network upgrade -- and AT&T concludes that ""Sprint appears to have delivered on its network performance promises to customers."" This is probably just about the only time you're going to hear and and Here's where the list starts to get a little silly: MetroPCS and Leap are described as ""the industry's leading mavericks,"" which might be the best line in the entire filing. They're grouped under the same bullet, ""all you can eat"" providers that focus on the value market. AT&T also points out that MetroPCS is outpacing T-Mobile in some markets -- quite an accomplishment for a regional carrier -- and both have LTE plans in place, allowing them to ""quickly fill any market gap T-Mobile USA leaves upon the completion of this transaction.""  and are described as which might be the best line in the entire filing.

""is also conducting LTE trials, which, according to CTO John Saw, have yielding 'mind blowing' results."" LightSquared won't even have a live network until later this year, but AT&T's already noting them as a competitor. They expect to cover about 100 million people with LTE by the end of 2012, and they have a deal in place with Leap.  The company also points to Android as both a cause and effect of ""intense competition"" within the industry, saying that the operating system is innovative and offers many apps, but that its ""extraordinarily rapid growth is also due to the fierce rivalry among wireless service providers.""  AT&T CTO John Donovan says that the merger will give the company ""sufficient"" spectrum to support its new LTE network prior to the next round of spectrum auctions, ""which will further enhance innovators’ confidence in deploying new devices and services on AT&T’s LTE network,"" which -- in turn -- would ""increase pressure on AT&T’s facilities-based wireless broadband competitors, including Verizon, Sprint, Clearwire, MetroPCS, Leap, and LightSquared, among others, to press for increased innovation on their own networks.""  Only AT&T can rescue T-Mobile from itself  The craziest bits in the entire filing may be AT&T's repeated putdowns of T-Mobile, saying that the carrier's ""absence from the marketplace will not have a significant competitive impact, particularly vis-à-vis AT&T."" Burn! The company says that it's too busy worrying about Verizon, Sprint, and ""rapidly growing mavericks like MetroPCS and Leap and other providers,"" which have already started to ""replace the diminished market role T-Mobile plays today."" In general, building the case for the merger puts AT&T in an extremely awkward position, because it needs to explain both why it'll be in a bad spot if it can't make jam the deal through -- something corporate spin doctors never like to do -- and downplay the competitive relevance of the company it's trying to buy.  AT&T repeatedly drives home the point that T-Mobile has no ""clear path"" to LTE deployment , noting that current parent Deutsche Telekom has refused to shake loose additional capital for the company to buy the spectrum it'd need; of course, the argument here is that AT&T gives T-Mobile that clear path.

""While Sprint has turned itself around within the past two years, and while industry upstarts MetroPCS and Leap have grown with astonishing rapidity, T-Mobile USA’s percentage of subscribers nationwide has declined since 2009.""  AT&T is also insistent that T-Mobile is not a real competitor -- after all, if T-Mo isn't real competition, than the merger won't affect the market. It's a little funny to think AT&T views Cincinnati Bell as bigger regional competition than T-Mobile, but according to AT&T Chief Marketing Office David Christopher, ""T-Mobile USA does not exert strong competitive pressure on AT&T,"" and ""AT&T views T-Mobile USA as a competitor of limited and declining significance.""  and The hits don't stop there, though -- AT&T says that T-Mobile doesn't have a ""particularly compelling portfolio of smartphone offerings.""  AT&T's also lying about HSPA+ being equivalent to 4G, so it doesn't slam T-Mobile too hard, but it does say "" T-Mobile USA’s HSPA+ launch appears to have been lost among other carriers’ 4G messaging.""  among other carriers’ 4G messaging."" According to AT&T, T-Mobile's "" business-oriented offerings are limited compared to those of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint.""  compared to those of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint."" It's not all dire, though -- and it's not often you hear a carrier admit that one of its competitors has better customer service: ""...because AT&T will adopt the best practices of each company, AT&T expects that its customers will benefit from T-Mobile USA’s industry-leading customer care practices.""  ""T-Mobile USA customers will also gain access to a broader range of current devices such as the iPhone, the iPad, and the ATRIX 4G, as well as faster access to the next generation of devices."" So there you have it, folks: the T-Mobile iPhone. Sort of.  AT&T says that existing T-Mobile customers ""who are happy"" with their current rate plans can keep them and they'll ""enjoy the benefits of improved service quality and thus a lower quality- adjusted price,"" but naturally, they'll be able to choose an AT&T plan as well. The undertone seems to be that T-Mobile's plans would be sunsetted for new subscribers, which is no surprise.  We'd wrap this up with a conclusion, but AT&T's already handled it for us. ""Simply put, AT&T does not generally focus its competitive energies on T-Mobile USA because in our view: 1) T-Mobile USA does not have a strong differentiating network claim; 2) it does not have a marquee device portfolio; and 3) its emphasis on lower, but not the lowest, prices has not resulted in T-Mobile USA winning customers away from AT&T on a net basis."" T-Mobile: it sucks so bad, AT&T wants to spend $39 billion on it.  AT&T's other major acquisition: the FLO TV spectrum  What about that 700MHz space that AT&T's buying from Qualcomm -- the spectrum formerly used for FLO TV?  Turns out the FLO spectrum is unpaired, which is kind of like the data equivalent of a half-duplex speakerphone. ""Although technological advances will allow unpaired spectrum to be integrated into two-way wireless technologies to supplement downlink capacity, the technical specifications for doing so in LTE will not be developed until 2012, and equipment manufacturers will then need substantial time to design, test, and build the relevant equipment. As a result, this spectrum likely will not be available until 2014 at the earliest.""  Meeting the government's nationwide broadband goals  One hot button AT&T's definitely pressing in this filing is the government's push for ubiquitous broadband, a goal the company says this merger will help meet.  As it mentions many, many times throughout the filing, the merger would take AT&T's total LTE footprint from roughly 80 percent of the US population to 97 percent, marking ""a quantum leap towards meeting the Administration’s rural broadband deployment objectives — without any expenditure of public funds.""  Regarding the fraction of the country that AT&T's pre-merger LTE plan doesn't cover: ""The remaining 20 percent of the population generally lives in less populated areas, including rural and smaller communities, where economies of scale and density are very low and per-customer costs are very high. And in some of these areas, AT&T simply lacks the spectrum necessary to deploy LTE. ""  "" AT&T says these rural deployments will help spur the creation of ""thousands of jobs,"" though it glosses over the fact that the $39 billion in ""synergies"" it hopes to create through the merger will probably lead to quite a few job cuts, too -- so it's unclear how the net will look.  Still playing the rural deployment card: ""LTE will bring especially significant benefits to residents of rural areas and smaller communities, where the benefits of real-time video and similar capabilities are most urgently needed to fill gaps in physical infrastructure for healthcare, education, and other social needs.""","competitor, merger, spectrum, company, lte, tmobile, att, network, market, highlights, atts, documentation, fcc, files",2011-04-21,The Verge

26,A tale of two-screens: from Echo and Iconia to the DS and Courier,Ross Miller,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/21/kyocera-echo-acer-iconia-tale-two-screens,"The Acer Iconia 6120 Touchbook and Kyocera Echo smartphone tackle the same subject with varying degrees of success and fundamental flaws. Acer IconiaThe Iconia Touchbook is more akin to a proof of concept or a prototype: some great ideas skinned over a platform that can’t handle it (Windows 7) and built into hardware not ready for prime time.

The Nintendo DS success storyIf there is a two-faced beacon of hope for this black sheep market segment, it’s Nintendo’s DS. Second, it has a solid ecosystem of software software built from the ground up with the DS in mind.","It’s not much of a stretch to label the dual-screen device market a niche experiment. Very few such machines exist, and with a notable exception, very few have made a impact at retail. So it’s more than a bit interesting to see two such devices launch in the same month. The Acer Iconia 6120 Touchbook and Kyocera Echo smartphone tackle the same subject with varying degrees of success and fundamental flaws. Is two at all better than one? Read on to find out.  Acer Iconia  The Iconia Touchbook is more akin to a proof of concept or a prototype: some great ideas skinned over a platform that can’t handle it (Windows 7) and built into hardware not ready for prime time. The Touchbook, as Acer calls it, weights 6.2 pounds and measures about 1.3 inches thick when closed, which is all just about on par with the Dell XPS 15 equipped with a 9-cell battery. Making it even less portable is a 4-cell Lithium Ion that in practice lasted just over two hours per charge. The two 14-inch, 1366 x 768 touchscreen displays can withstand quite the digit-beating thanks to Gorilla Glass, but at the same time doesn’t always seem to register my clicks. Worse still, the pair suffers from a trifecta of annoyances: heavy glare, pronounced fingerprint smudging, and bad vertical viewing angles. These are all particularly noticeable on the bottom screen, which won’t be in an optimal viewing position unless you’ve got the device propped on an incline. The virtual keyboard is still very usable, but reading text just won’t happen...  Kyocera Echo  There’s not much to the Kyocera Echo’s single-screen mode—in this light, it’s just a bulky Android 2.2 phone with a 3.5-inch, 480 x 800 display and a 1GHz QSD8650 Snapdragon processor. It’s snappy, sure, but the competition is fierce in that form factor. No, Kyocera has placed its hopes on standing out with an altogether unique design. The screens actually stack facing the same direction, instead of sandwiched glass-to-glass. Opening to tablet is an altogether awkward process that involves flipping it open, swiveling the screens to both facing you, and locking it flat side-by-side to a 4.7-inch, 960 x 800 surface. The hinge itself feels decently sturdy, although everyone I showed it to all expressed concerned they’d break it. I’ve applied a good bit of pressure on a few occasions just to see if it’d bend or show strain—only slightly. You can choose to leave the top screen at a small incline, but then it’s not locked in, and I promise you’ll be spending most of your time accidentally (or maybe purposely) tapping the back and causing it to swing to and fro...  The Nintendo DS success story  If there is a two-faced beacon of hope for this black sheep market segment, it’s Nintendo’s DS. The successor to the Game Boy launched in 2004 with much fanfare but games that critics said underutilized the additional display. The New York Times said it best in reviewing the launch titles:  ""Most DS titles feel as though they were designed for Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, with the bottom screen used for something marginally useful, like a map, or for an option that could easily have been put elsewhere. The DS gimmick feels largely irrelevant in these games""  That sentiment, however, did nothing to deter gamers from buying the system en masse, and as of December 2010 it was on the cusp of breaking 150 million units sold, second only to the PlayStation 2.  So what worked? If you ask me—and you probably didn’t, but I’ll continue anyway—Nintendo benefited in two very strong and very important ways. First, there was solid legacy support. Consumers could pick up a DS and still use their Game Boy Advance flawlessly—it just worked, with the same buttons and no hiccup in performance. Second, it has a solid ecosystem of software software built from the ground up with the DS in mind. You can easily argue that a vast majority of releases were, in a word, garbage, and I’m not about to disagree. But there were numerous titles that went on to become successful both critically and financially. It helps, too, that Nintendo has a talented in-house team of developers and an assortment if iconic characters -- the company could lead by example and serve as flagship templates with its first-party lineups. It remains to be seen if the good fortune will continue with the 3DS  Wrap-up, or what lies in the shadow of the Courier  Both the Iconia and Echo were doomed to struggle from the get-go. For all the reasons I could think of to explain the DS’s good fortune, none of those exist with this pair. The success of the hardware is dependant upon its relation to the software, and here we have single-screen platforms jury-rigged to a design it was never intended for. The Echo at least benefits from an OS designed to work without physical input -- it’s an imperfect set up, sure, but it’s usable. Acer’s made it clear that it intends Iconia to be a series of products, so hopefully the next generation Touchbook isn’t an alpha build.  I’ve no doubt there’s a market out there’s a market for dual-screen touch devices, but it’s clear there are some fundamental rules that need to be observed:  Wide viewing angles are a necessity. If a use case for the screen(s) is 45 degrees off eye level, it should still be viewable.  You can’t teach an old dog new tricks. As we’ve seen countless times with Windows 7 tablets, a platform designed without touch in mind will eventually suffer from user experience on some level. This is pretty applicable across tablets, but dual-screen devices have the added pressure of ""designing around the hinge,"" so to speak.  If it’s gonna serve as a primary machine (i.e. a laptop, smartphone), then it needs to as functional as the single-screen device it replaces.  Twice the screen means more battery drain. Something to keep in mind.  Look far enough into the future and you can start imagining a time where dual-screens—if they are ever to become a ""thing""—be marginalized by gadgets built around flexible OLED panels. That’s great, but the above rules still apply.","tale, echo, x, singlescreen, viewing, success, twoscreens, market, screen, ds, software, iconia, courier, touchbook",2011-04-21,The Verge

Prior to the update, the Focus had been one of the few branded phones on the network that actually used HSUPA -- which was apparently a mistake, because the update disables it. [Update: If you had manually enabled it prior to the update, the update turned it off again — but it was never using HSUPA by default. Now, even in light of the company line that these phones need to be handshaking Release 5 for some unknown reason, this is pretty inexcusable. Needless to say, there are dozens of iPhones that connect to any given AT&T tower for each Windows Phone 7 device.","Look, AT&T: Windows Phone 7 owners have it hard enough right now as it is. Do you really need to pile on?  But let's rewind for a second; here's the backstory. AT&T-locked handsets (other than the iPhone 4, notably) have shown suspiciously slow upload speeds for some time, but the problem really started sticking out like a sore thumb on recent models that bear ""4G"" branding on account of their HSPA+ support -- namely, the HTC Inspire 4G and Motorola Atrix 4G. Why couldn't they even break a megabit on the uplink? We followed the story closely on Engadget, eventually hearing from a tipster that the company was requiring its branded phones to handshake 3GPP Release 5 with the network -- the last release to lack support for HSUPA. In other words, AT&T was (and still is) holding devices back and preventing them from uploading data at the full speeds they're capable of.  They've never really come clean on why they're doing this. If I had to guess, it's mainly out of an abundance of caution in protecting the performance of the network as technicians slowly beef up backhaul and enable HSPA+ around the country, which is a woefully wrongheaded approach that alienates customers... but it is an approach. For what it's worth, they've committed to updating some existing models to enable HSUPA once they've been tested -- and naturally, there'll be more models down the road that have it enabled out of the box -- but there's never been a straight, official answer on why they've been disabling it thus far.  That brings us to the occasion of the delayed Windows Phone 7 ""NoDo"" update for AT&T's Samsung Focus, which just started rolling out in the past few days. Prior to the update, the Focus had been one of the few branded phones on the network that actually used HSUPA -- which was apparently a mistake, because the update disables it. No warning, no letter from AT&T to owners explaining that their phones are going to be crippled and slowed... just an apparent expectation that Focus owners won't figure out (or won't care) that they've been hoodwinked.  [Update: If you had manually enabled it prior to the update, the update turned it off again — but it was never using HSUPA by default. See the full update below.]  Now, even in light of the company line that these phones need to be handshaking Release 5 for some unknown reason, this is pretty inexcusable. How many HSUPA devices does it take to break an AT&T cell site? Punchline: more than just Focuses alone, that's for sure. If negative impact on the network were seriously a concern, anyway, they'd need to be looking at the massive installed base of iPhone 4s that are uploading HSUPA -- not the occasional Focus. Needless to say, there are dozens of iPhones that connect to any given AT&T tower for each Windows Phone 7 device.  Fortunately, there's a silver lining on this cloud: it turns out that re-enabling HSUPA on the Focus is pretty simple, and WPCentral lays it out. Interestingly, the fix also confirms that scoop we'd posted a while back on Engadget, too, which claimed that the problem revolved around 3GPP Releases: to get HSUPA pumping on the Focus, you need to literally change a setting from Release 5 to Release 6. That's it.  If there's one thing AT&T needs to learn here, it's that the hive mind of users, enthusiasts, and media will always root this sort of stuff out. And when they do, it's going to backfire. If your phones can support HSUPA, you've got to have it enabled.

The Samsung lawsuit[embed title=""Samsung""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-Samsung.mp3[/embed]Surprisingly, there was only one question on the Samsung lawsuit, and Tim Cook clearly had a prepared answer.","Apple announced its Q2 2011 results today, and yes -- it's been another record quarter in Cupertino, with profits of $5.99 billion on $24.67 billion in revenue. That's up almost double last year's $3.07b profits on $13.50b in revenue. Profit margins held steady at 41.4 percent, so it seems the big numbers mostly to do with increased sales. And what an increase: Apple sold 3.76 million Macs, which is a 28 percent increase and quarterly record 18.65 million iPhones, which is a 113 percent increase. The iPod line continued to decline, down 17 percent to 9.02 million, and iPad sales were less than expected at 4.69 million -- due to what acting CEO Tim Cook called ""the mother of all backlogs."" We've got the complete call posted below, along with some point-by-point analysis.  [embed title=""Apple Q2 2011 results call""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/apple-q2-11-call.mp3[/embed]  Effects of the earthquake in Japan  [embed title=""Japan""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-Japan.mp3[/embed]  Analysts asked about the earthquake in Japan and its effects on Apple's business immediately. After noting that the earthquake was a terrible tragedy with a far greater human impact than business impact, Tim Cook went on to say that neither Apple's supply chains or costs will be impacted next quarter. Apple sources ""hundreds"" of parts from Japan, but Apple employees have worked around the clock implementing contingency plans with their suppliers, and the preference is to stay with their long-term partners.  iPad 2 supply issues  [embed title=""iPad2""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-iPad2.mp3[/embed]  Of course, if the Japanese tragedy isn't affecting iPad 2 supply, analysts want to know what is -- and neither Tim Cook nor Peter Oppenheimer were very forthcoming on that. Cook said iPad 2 demand has been ""staggering"" and that Apple has been ""amazed"" by it -- at one point he called the pent-up orders ""the mother of all backlogs."" However, he also said that he's pleased with Apple's progress in ramping up manufacturing to fill demand, and that the company is confident enough in its ability to meet demand that it's launching the iPad 2 in 13 more countries next week.  When asked if there had simply been an error in forecasting iPad 2 demand, Cook was a little more circumspect, saying ""product transitions are never easy,"" but that Apple was off to a better start with the iPad 2 than with the original iPad. CFO Peter Oppenheimer later declined to say how many iPad 1's had been sold vs iPad 2's, but did say that ""I wish we'd produced more iPad 2s, as a lot of people are waiting for them.""  Verizon iPhone sales  [embed title=""Verizon""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-Verizon.mp3[/embed]  US iPhone sales grew 155 percent from this quarter last year, which is three times faster than the US phone market is growing in general. Tim Cook said Verizon was ""key"" in that, but AT&T also did extremely well, with 3.6 million iPhones activated last quarter, a million more than a year ago.  Mac sales: ""the only guys focused on innovative products""  [embed title=""Mac""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-MacSales.mp3[/embed]  Mac sales were up 28 percent to 3.76m. Tim Cook said that the Mac is ""enormous"" in Asia and that the US had a ""surprisingly strong"" quarter, before noting that the Mac has had 20 straight quarters of outgrowing the PC market, which he thinks is stagnating. ""We seem to be the only guys that are really focused on building innovative products."" He also sees a ""great future"" for both portables like the MacBook line and desktops like the iMac.  Is Android like Windows?  [embed title=""Android2""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-Android2.mp3[/embed]  Not for the first time, an analyst asked if Android posed the same threat to iOS as Windows did to the original Mac. Tim was pretty blunt in response, saying that the latest comScore numbers have iOS outreaching Android by 59 percent in the US and that the iPhone continues to outgrow the market. Tim also revisited Apple's ""integrated over fragmented"" argument, saying that ""the user appreciates that Apple can take full responsibility for their experience, and few customers want to be a systems integrator.""  Steve Jobs  [embed title=""Jobs""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-Jobs.mp3[/embed]  When asked about Steve Job's health, Tim Cook said that although Steve is still on medical leave, he's still involved and ""we see him on a regular basis...he wants to be back as soon as he can.""  The Samsung lawsuit  [embed title=""Samsung""]http://cdn0.sbnation.com/podcasts/APLQ211-Samsung.mp3[/embed]  Surprisingly, there was only one question on the Samsung lawsuit, and Tim Cook clearly had a prepared answer. ""We are Samsung's largest customer, and Samsung is a very valued component supplier to us. I expect a strong relationship will continue. Separately from this, we felt the mobile communications business of Samsung had crossed the line, and after trying for some time to work through the issue we decided we needed to rely on the courts.""","samsung, quarter, demand, results, financial, q2, apples, tim, million, sales, asked, ipad, breakdown, cook, apple, 2011",2011-04-20,The Verge
31,Forming a Continuous Client Coalition,Paul Miller,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/20/forming-continuous-client-coalition-2,"Here's his summary:So what is a Continuous Client you ask? Now, there are plenty of truly excellent, or at least usable, examples of Continuous Client functionality that have already been built into single products:Kindle Whispersync - Our best and brightest. Trillian - They actually call it Continuous Client! The Continuous Client. Well, I propose that we form a Continuous Client Coalition.","One of my favorite pieces ever published on Engadget was written by my good pal Joshua Topolsky, wherein he coins the term ""Continuous Client"" and describes a beautiful dream so named. Here's his summary:  So what is a Continuous Client you ask? Well the premise is simple: when you leave one device, you pick up your session in exactly the same place on the next device you use. Meaning your IM, Twitter, web browsing, applications, even your windows (given the availability of such a thing on the corresponding platform) appear just as they did on the previous device.  Now, there are plenty of truly excellent, or at least usable, examples of Continuous Client functionality that have already been built into single products:  Kindle Whispersync - Our best and brightest.  Trillian - They actually call it Continuous Client!  Firefox Sync - Almost exactly what we want.  FreshStart - Save and send sessions for Chrome.  The problem is that nobody does this. That is to say, nobody does this for everything. I want a single service that syncs multiple apps at once, and a service that translates those app states generically, so that I can use my browser or Twitter client or e-reader of choice for each platform.  It's wild to me that a tech industry defined by its vertical integrators (Apple, Google, Microsoft-ish) hasn't at least figured out the first half of that equation. It would certainly be a start, but I don't think it would be enough. We need an open standard ™ to make sure we get both parts of this dream.  I also don't want to be locked into the first manufacturer to figure this out. Maybe that's in the manufacturer's best interest, but it isn't in the best interest of the user. And here's a little newsflash: users will eventually win, and get what they want and what they need. Because they have the dollars.  So, how do we get there sooner, rather than later? I propose an open standard. The Continuous Client. (Josh has been gracious enough to lend his term to this effort).  How would it work?  Each user has one file, called cc_username.xml  The file lives in ""the cloud."" It doesn't matter where, it just has to be readable and editable from any internet-connected device. I plan on putting cc_futurepaul.xml on my Dropbox, which means it will be secure and everywhere. This is similar to how 1Password operates on multiple devices. If someone wants to set up a more formalized and secure service to deal with this file (like Firefox Sync), then that's fine too.  The file defines two main things:  The devices owned by the user, CC-compatible applications on that device, and the CC ""session types"" that each app can handle (Tweeting, browsing). The current session, broken down with generic session data (Twitter, browser tabs) and custom app-specific data (Twitter.exe, Chrome.exe tabs).  Other things that might be nice to include, but aren't as fundamental:  An option to save a mobile session separately from a desktop session.  A session archive of some sort.  References to docs-in-progress and where they're stored in the cloud (this would work particularly well if the CC file is in a Dropbox or similar cloud storage setup).  Media playback continuation. Possibly over DLNA if the file isn't stored in the cloud.  So, cc_futurepaul.xml exists, and it's on my Dropbox. Let's do this.  I'm currently working on my PC, but I'm about to head out the door and I want to continue my work on the iPhone. What do I do?  There is an application on my PC (cc.exe, let's call it) that does all the work. I can set it up to either capture my session in CC-compatible apps every few minutes, or just have a manual ""eject"" button when I'm ready to leave one system and move on to another. I think I'd probably use CC manually.  I push ""eject."" A pop-up (that I specified) asks me what I actually want to bring along. I can uncheck a window full of tabs that I'm tired of, and then click confirm. It writes my new session to cc_futurepaul.xml, and Dropbox syncs the changed file.  Now I pull out my phone. I've already set up some of my apps to call on my cc_futurepaul.xml file, so when I launch Twitter.app it syncs up to the brand new saved session from my desktop and scrolls to the exact same Tweet I was looking at on my computer. When I open Opera.app it automatically opens the maximum number of ""tabs"" it can handle, prioritizing the most recent ones. At the forefront is the webpage I was just on, scrolled to the same position on the page. I pull up Simplenote and the same text document I was working on in Notational Velocity is pulled up, cursor blinking at the exact same place.  Does that sound interesting to you? It sounds amazing to me.  How do we get there?  Well, I propose that we form a Continuous Client Coalition. It would be composed of some interested users (like me) and some interested developers. We would work together to define the scope of the functionality and the specific syntax of the xml document. Then, if a specific developer is happy with the results, they can go about implementing CC support in whatever applications they think it would be suited to. There would be a formal process for adding new generic session types to be supported, but a dev could put any sort of data under their own app-specific tags (with the limitation of some number of bytes per app, so that the xml file doesn't get too large).  The first implementation I'd like to see out of the gate would simply be a Chrome extension that would allow me to at least maintain browser sessions from desktop computer to desktop computer. A Pidgin / Adium extension would be great as well, and a Twitter app or two with support would be icing on the preliminary cake. I'm no dev, but I don't think implementation for at least these initial applications would be that difficult (maybe that's why I'm no dev). Deeper implementation and mobile implementation would hopefully happen, but probably only after these initial uses start to gain traction. Having a Google or Apple or Microsoft adopt the standard would be the holy grail, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Together we can build a better world. A world where the ""session"" revolves around the user, not around the device.

I don't think anyone would use the F700 interface and think it's an iPhone, and I don't think anyone using the iPhone today is thinking about the F700. But do people see TouchWiz and think ""oh, that's an iPhone?""","So this very funny picture of a Samsung F700 and the original iPhone is like the lolcat companion to my Apple / Samsung lawsuit analysis from yesterday. I'm seeing it everywhere, and it's been sent to me several times. I definitely laughed when I saw it -- at first glance it's very well-done, apart from the ""being"" typo in the headline. (I have no idea where it came from, though -- did you make it? Tell me and I'll link you up.)  Unfortunately, however, it's also factually inaccurate: the F700 was announced in Feburary 2007 at Mobile World Congress, after the iPhone was announced in January at MacWorld, and it's actually a chunky 16.4mm-thick slider QWERTY that looks appreciably different than the iPhone. It also has a homescreen that's quite different than iOS -- what you're seeing above is the function menu. (Remember, it was a dumbphone: no apps!) But that's been hashed out all over the place. I want to point out something else. Let's look at the F700 in a different context. Instead of looking at the similarities, let's try to highlight the differences.  I think it's pretty clear here that one of these things is not like the others. The entire aesthetic of the F700 interface is significantly different than either iOS or TouchWiz: the icons are monochrome and have unique designs, there's that cool X/Y highlight on the selected icon, there's a text label at the top. And the list goes on, especially if you look at the F700's actual homescreen:  These aren't just minor differences: they combine to create an entire user experience that is instantly and recognizably different than an Apple or iOS product. In many ways, the F700 does nothing but underline Apple's overall contention: that there are thousands of ways to design and package a phone interface, but Samsung chose to drop its differentiated interface and instead lift elements of Apple's style for TouchWiz. I don't think anyone would use the F700 interface and think it's an iPhone, and I don't think anyone using the iPhone today is thinking about the F700. But do people see TouchWiz and think ""oh, that's an iPhone?"" That's the most important thing when it comes to trade dress and trademark: what brand does the average consumer associate with certain design elements, phrases, and words? That relationship is incredibly valuable, especially to a company like Apple. Ironically, if Samsung had just continued to develop the interface ideas shown in the F700, it likely wouldn't be facing this particular lawsuit -- Apple's cases against Motorola, HTC, and Nokia are all based on technical system-level utility patents, not trade dress, trademark, or design patents.","samsung, design, iphone, picture, think, interface, different, touchwiz, talk, f700, lets, thats, ios",2011-04-20,The Verge
33,Apple sues Samsung: a complete lawsuit analysis,Nilay Patel,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/19/apple-sues-samsung-analysis,"First claim: Trade dress infringement under 15 U.S.C. Similarly, Apple's claim is that the iPhone's box and design scream ""Apple"" to consumers just as strongly as the word ""iPhone."" Oh, and don't conflate trade dress with Apple's doomed copyright-based ""look and feel"" lawsuit against Microsoft in the 90s — it's totally different. Trade dress law is well-established, and Apple itself has a history of successfully pursuing trade dress claims in the Northern District of California. Think about it like this: if you designed a new phone with a novel design, you could get a design patent.","Apple sued Samsung yesterday, the latest in a long line of IP lawsuits against Android device manufacturers. (See: Apple v. HTC, Apple v. Motorola, Microsoft v. Motorola, Microsoft v. Barnes & Noble.) The case is remarkable for several reasons, not least because Samsung is one of Apple's critical component suppliers: the Korean giant manufactures everything from DRAM and SSDs for MacBook Pros to the A4 and A5 processors in the iPhone, iPod touch, Apple TV, and iPad. That relationship doesn't seem to have softened Apple's tone; the company's complaint bluntly says ""Instead of pursuing independent product development, Samsung has chosen to slavishly copy Apple’s innovative technology, distinctive user interfaces, and elegant and distinctive product and packaging design, in violation of Apple’s valuable intellectual property rights."" Oh boy.  The immediate takeaway is simple: Apple isn't afraid to sue anyone when it comes to protecting its IP. You might also surmise that Apple demanded Samsung stop infringing its IP or pay a royalty and Samsung refused; a filed complaint is generally just evidence that more cordial negotiations failed. But that's the easy reaction to the simple fact of Apple suing Samsung. The real dirt is in the complaint itself, which was filed on the 15th and made public today. It's actually quite interesting, both because of the claims themselves and their structure — this lawsuit is as much about TouchWiz and Samsung's penchant for lifting design elements as it is about the core of Android. We've got a copy, which you can download right here — grab it and follow along after the break.  Background  The background section of Apple's complaint has a couple interesting nuggets in it: Apple's sold ""over 60 million"" iPod touches as of March 2011, which is the first time a specific number has ever been broken out for that device, and we're also told that 108m iPhones and 19m iPads have been sold. What's more, Apple spent more than $2 billion advertising the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad during its fiscal years 2007 to 2010.  It's in this section that Apple also lays out what it considers to be its protectable intellectual property: seven utility patents, three design patents, trademarks on several iOS system app icons, and a host of trade dress registrations on the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and the packaging that each comes in. (Yes, the packaging — companies spend millions designing gadget boxes, after all.)  We're also told that Apple views the Samsung Captivate, Continuum, Vibrant, Galaxy S 4G, Epic 4G, Indulge, Mesmerize, Showcase, Fascinate, Nexus S, Gem, Transform, Intercept, and Acclaim phones as infringing its various IP, as well as the Galaxy Tab. It's also clear Apple has particular scorn for TouchWiz'd Galaxy S devices, saying ""The copying is so pervasive, that [they] appear to be actual Apple products."" The rest of the background section is really just the foundation for Apple's actual claims, so let's take a look at them in order and talk about what they mean, shall we?  The claims  We're going to take the claims one-by-one, but structurally it's notable that trade dress is the first listed claim, as claims are traditionally ordered by some combination of perceived strength and importance. Apple was forced to focus on deeply-technical underlying Android system patents when it sued HTC and Motorola because Sense and Blur are highly differentiated from iOS and the actual products have unique hardware and packaging designs, but Samsung all but invited these additional and somewhat more subjective claims by hewing so closely to Apple's conventions. And at this stage of the game, more claims generally means more liability.  First claim: Trade dress infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1125  You're probably familiar with patents, copyrights, and trademarks, the three main types of intellectual property. Trade dress is the wonky red-headed step-cousin of the family that fills the gaps between the three; you might think of it as a trademark on design elements that trigger consumer recognition. (That's a vastly simplified explanation, but it's good enough for our purposes.) Trademarks and trade dress are all about protecting consumers from being deceived in the marketplace — the idea is to clearly indicate the source of a product or service.  Think of it this way: the trademark ""iPhone"" is a made up word that consumers recognize, so Samsung can't call its phones the ""Galaxy iPhone"" because that would confuse consumers about the source of the product. Similarly, Apple's claim is that the iPhone's box and design scream ""Apple"" to consumers just as strongly as the word ""iPhone."" Simple, right?  Oh, and don't conflate trade dress with Apple's doomed copyright-based ""look and feel"" lawsuit against Microsoft in the 90s — it's totally different. Trade dress law is well-established, and Apple itself has a history of successfully pursuing trade dress claims in the Northern District of California. In 2000 the company sued both eMachines and a company called Future Power for knocking off the iMac's trade dress, winning injunctions in both cases and eventually getting extremely restrictive settlements that effectively removed the infringing products from the marketplace.  So with all that background, here's Apple's list of trade dress elements it thinks Samsung is infringing:  Hardware and software trade dress claims  a rectangular product shape with all four corners uniformly rounded;  the front surface of the product dominated by a screen surface with black borders;  as to the iPhone and iPod touch products, substantial black borders above and below the screen having roughly equal width and narrower black borders on either side of the screen having roughly equal width;  as to the iPad product, substantial black borders on all sides being roughly equal in width;  a metallic surround framing the perimeter of the top surface;  a display of a grid of colorful square icons with uniformly rounded corners; and  a bottom row of square icons (the ""Springboard"") set off from the other icons and that do not change as the other pages of the user interface are viewed.  Packaging trade dress claims  a rectangular box with minimal metallic silver lettering and a large front-viewpicture of the product prominently on the top surface of the box;  a two-piece box wherein the bottom piece is completely nested in the top piece; and  use of a tray that cradles products to make them immediately visible upon opening the box.  Now, some of these are a little ridiculous when taken individually — is Apple going to sue every digital photo frame maker that puts equal size black borders around the screen as well? — but in the end, the main question for the court will be whether or not Samsung has used all of these elements in a way that's likely to confuse consumers about what they're buying. Does the overall impression of Samsung's hardware and software lead people to think it's actually from Apple? Does the box? (We're simplifying again, but that's the crux of the issue.) In response, Samsung's best bet is to argue that its products and packaging aren't confusingly similar, and if that doesn't work, to somehow prove that consumers aren't actually being confused. It sounds simple, but, well, that's only because we're simplifying it. In reality this one claim alone will cost both parties millions of dollars to litigate. And there are 15 more to go — so let's get to it.  Second claim: Federal trade dress infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114  This second trade dress claim is the more simple and direct of the two, because it deals with three specific iPhone trade dress elements Apple's registered with the US Patent and Trademark office. That means Apple's already convinced the USPTO these elements are distinctive and protectable; with the first claim Apple will have to start from scratch.  U.S. Registration No. 3,470,983 is for the overall design of the product, including the rectangular shape, the rounded corners, the silver edges, the black face, and the display of sixteen colorful icons.  U.S. Registration No. 3,457,218 is for the configuration of a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic device with rounded corners.  U.S. Registration No. 3,475,327 is for a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic device with a gray rectangular portion in the center, a black band above and below the gray rectangle and on the curved corners, and a silver outer border and side.  For Samsung, it's the same story: the best strategy is to deny any similarities, and back that up with data that shows consumers aren't actually being confused.  Third claim: Federal trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114  This one's pretty simple, and on its face it looks like the strongest claim of them all: Apple's registered trademarks on several iOS system icons, and TouchWiz includes six icons that look almost exactly the same. The facts here literally line right up — we'll put the iOS icon on the left and the TouchWiz icon on the right.  No. 3,886,196 is the iOS phone app icon.  No. 3,886,196 is the iOS phone app icon. No. 3,889,642 is the iOS messaging app icon.  No. 3,886,200 is the iOS photos app icon.  No. 3,889,685 is the iOS settings app icon.  No. 3,886,169 is the iOS notes app icon.  No. 3,886,197 is the iOS contacts icon.  Pending No. 85/041,463 is the iTunes icon, which is a riff on U.S. Registration No. 2,935,038, the desktop iTunes logo.  It's going to be far harder for Samsung to argue out of some of these — in some cases, like the phone icon, the similarities are impossible to ignore. You might argue that the design of the phone icon is ridiculously trivial and obvious, but consider the flipside: Apple can argue just as persuasively that Samsung had a million options for a phone icon and instead chose a white handset resting at an angle on a green gradient background. Samsung's lawyers are going to have get creative with this one.  Fourth claim: common law trademark infringement  This one's a catch-all — it's there to pick up the pieces from the federal trademark claims and to strengthen the claim on the iTunes icon, which is still pending registration.  Fifth claim: Unfair business practices under the California Business and Professions Code  This is a state-level version of the trade dress and trademark claims - it's there to pick up the pieces in case the federal claims somehow don't pass muster. I'm not a California lawyer, so I'm not too familiar with these statutes — let me know if I missed something important here.  Sixth claim: Unjust enrichment  Yet another state-level claim that feels like a catch-all in case everything else fails — Apple's arguing that whether or not Samsung's conduct rose to actual infringement its trade dress, trademarks, and patents, Samsung still unfairly profited by copying Apple's work.  Let's skip ahead here and deal with the design patents now as well, since they're of the same theme — you might as well call this bundle the Galaxy / TouchWiz claims, since they're all to do with Samsung-specific hardware and software.  Claims fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen: infringement of design patents  Just when you were getting your head around trade dress, we're throwing design patents into the mix. There's actually a pretty simple relationship between the two — if trade dress is all about the product design's relationship to the consumer, a design patent is all about the design of the product itself. Think about it like this: if you designed a new phone with a novel design, you could get a design patent. Once you started selling it and your customers started associating that design with your products, you'd be protected by trade dress. (Again, a gross simplification, but we're aiming for broad contours here.) Oh, and design patents expire just like every other patent, while trade dress lasts as long as the item is in commerce. The classic example is the Coke bottle, which carries a distinctive decorative shape — it was given a design patent that eventually expired, but it's still protected under trade dress because consumers associate that shape with Coca-Cola.  The rule for design patent infringement is relatively simple: if the two designs are substantially similar enough to trick an ordinary person into thinking they're the same, it's probably an infringement. Got it? So let's look at Apple's three iPhone design patents.  Patent #D627,790: Graphical User Interface For a Display Screen or Portion Thereof. This is the iOS homescreen — the grid of icons.  Patent #D602,016: Electronic Device. This is the iPhone 3G / 3GS design, as seen to the left. The broken lines that form the screen and the button aren't part of the patent, just the device's shell, so any button or screen size differences on Samsung's devices don't matter.  Patent #D618,677: Electronic Device. This is the opposite of '677 — it's the screen and button design of the iPhone. The broken lines that form the case aren't part of the patent.  Okay, so that's all the Samsung-specific stuff. At nine claims out of sixteen, it's actually the bulk of the lawsuit — making this case much different than Apple's other lawsuits against Android phone manufacturers. But that doesn't mean there isn't some Android-related stuff in here. Far from it, in fact — in addition to asserting some of the same patents against Android that it's using in other lawsuits, Apple's picked out several new ones that we haven't seen litigated yet. Let's burn through them.  Seventh claim: Infringement of the '002 patent  Patent #6,493,002, delightfully titled Method and Apparatus for Displaying and Accessing Control and Status Information in a Computer System, is new to the Apple / Android litigation party. It was filed in 1997 and granted in 2002, so the connection to iOS and Android is a little harder to see — it covers a system that pops open a window to show multiple interactive control widgets. The drawings are of the old OS 9 control bar, but one could see how this applies to the Android control widgets. We'll have to see what Apple specifically argues with this one.  Eighth claim: Infringement of the '381 patent  You remember Patent #7,469,381, don't you? List Scrolling and Document Translation, Scaling and Rotation on a Touch-Screen Display? No, of course you don't. You are busy having a real life, and possibly interacting with other humans. '381 is one of Apple's first iOS-related patents — it covers the ""bounce"" effect you get on iOS when you scroll to the top or bottom of a list. We talked about it way back in January 2009 when everyone thought Apple cared enough about Palm's impact on the market to do anything except patiently wait for a six-month Sprint exclusive to slowly and inevitably choke the company to death. Those, friends — those were the days.  Apple's also asserted '381 against Nokia and HTC, so it obviously feels that it's strong enough to withstand a triple-headed attack on its validity.  Ninth claim: Infringement of the '134 patent  Patent #7,669,134 is titled Method and Apparatus For Displaying Information During An Instant Messaging Session, and that's no lie — it covers arranging incoming messages in a communications session in a timeline that's horizontally spaced. In simple terms? It covers the iChat and iOS cartoon-bubble chat interface. That's pretty much exactly what Samsung's TouchWiz chat interface looks like.  Tenth claim: Infringement of the '828 patent  Patent #7,812,828 is a wonky technical patent related to touchscreen input — titled Ellipse Fitting For Multi-Touch Surfaces, it covers taking touch impressions mapping them to ellipses. Apple's also asserting this one against Motorola, so Cupertino's lawyers probably feel pretty good about it — and when a patent lawyer friend of mine read it, he actually said ""whoa, nice claim."" This is a true story.  Eleventh claim: Infringement of the '915 patent  Patent #7,844,915 is titled Application programming interfaces for scrolling operations, and it covers deciding when a user is using one finger to scroll a view versus two or more fingers to scale that same view. At first read, this seems like a pretty fundamental multitouch patent, so we'll see how successfully Samsung challenges it — if it holds up, Apple will have a very potent arrow in its quiver.  Twelfth claim: Infringement of the '891 patent  Patent #7,853,891, titled Method and apparatus for displaying a window for a user interface, covers displaying an overlay window over the standard UI in response to a keystroke and having it disappear automatically after some predefined amount of time. In other words, it covers things like the iOS volume display, which automatically fades out after you've adjusted the volume. This is a relatively new patent, just granted on December 14, 2010, so we'll see what the courts do with it -- there are plenty of elements in Android that exhibit this behavior.  Thirteenth claim: Infringement of the '533 patent  Hate software patents? Well, you're in luck. Patent #7,863,533 is an old-school hardware patent. Titled Cantilevered push button having multiple contacts and fulcrums, it covers the volume rocker on the iPhone 3G and 3GS — a volume rocker that looks quite like the one on Samsung's various Galaxy S devices. We can't know for sure whether they're the same without tearing things apart, but Apple certainly thinks there's a bit of unwarranted inspiration going on.  Lastly, I would note that Apple didn't include Patent #7,479,949, which it's alleging against Motorola and HTC — it seems to cover a very basic iOS scrolling behavior that appears in Android. There are some seriously deep considerations at play in deciding what patents to assert against which opponents, and I'd love to know why Apple's making some of the choices it's making. This is multibillion-dollar chess.  Apple's damages  So now that Apple's made its case, what does it want the court to do? Simple — it wants Samsung to pay up for the infringements in the past and stop infringing in the future. Specifically, Apple's asking the court to permanently forbid Samsung and its various divisions and suppliers from ever infringing Apple's claimed IP again, as well as triple damages for patent infringement, any wrongful profits Samsung might have gained from using Apple's IP, some punitive damages, money for corrective advertising, and the cost of Apple's attorney's fees. That's all pretty standard stuff, but it's all very dependent on the claims themselves — and by the time a judge or jury is deciding on damages, the claims will have been argued into something very different. That's years from now.  A brief aside  Before we wrap up, I just want to highlight something I noticed in the complaint that made me laugh: this image of a Samsung Galaxy S 4G, taken by Engadget's Myriam Joire, and this image of a Samsung Galaxy Tab's box that was posted on AndroidCommunity. It doesn't seem like Apple's law firm asked for or received permission to use either image in the complaint. There's something embarrassingly ironic about a high-priced law firm making a basic copyright error like this in a complaint that argues ""slavish"" and ""pervasive"" copying, but it has less to do with Apple's case against Samsung and more to do with how disconnected from reality our copyright law has become. There's more on my personal blog if for some reason you're interested in the wonky details.  What happens next?  So that's the rundown — the sixteen specific claims Apple's making against Samsung, as well as what it's asking the court to do. Taken as a group, it feels like a remarkably solid case — Samsung can't just up and countersue Apple with its own patents and hope to walk away with a handshake and a cross-license because of the various trademark, trade dress, and design patent claims. How the company decides to deal with those issues remains to be seen; there's no question in my mind that Samsung designed TouchWiz to look and feel as much like iOS as possible, and then marketed it as such. (More than one of my friends has come back from a Verizon store with a Fascinate having been told that it's ""basically the same as an iPhone."")  In that context, Apple's Android-specific patent claims almost seem like a foundation on which to build the case against TouchWiz, not the indirect swipe at Android itself that I've come to expect from these lawsuits. Depending on the strength of Samsung's promised reply and countersuit, my guess is that Apple might be willing to eventually settle the patent claims but will push the trademark and trade dress claims as far as it can — if Apple loses those it's open season on the iOS aesthetic. You can bet Steve Jobs and Tim Cook aren't about to let that happen.","samsung, ios, dress, design, lawsuit, claim, apples, claims, analysis, trade, sues, apple, patent, complete",2011-04-19,The Verge
34,LG G-Slate review,Joshua Topolsky,https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2510567/lg-g-slate-review,"As I intimated in the opening paragraph, the G-Slate probably won’t get famous for being the most unique looking tablet on the block. As with the Xoom, the front of the tablet is taken up by a big, beautiful display. Oddly, LG has placed the webcam off to the left corner of the slate (if you’re holding it in landscape mode, which Android 3.0 encourages you to do). A volume rocker is nearby on the top left edge of the frame, but weirdly works inverse to the volume slider display — tapping left raises the volume, right lowers it. The device feels unnaturally long; though it has a 8.9-inch screen, it’s longer and thinner than the Xoom (9.56 inches by 5.88 inches).","As I intimated in the opening paragraph, the G-Slate probably won’t get famous for being the most unique looking tablet on the block. While the edges are a little softer and the materials a little smoother here, the overall look and feel is akin to the Xoom. In fact, the devices are almost the identical thickness.  As with the Xoom, the front of the tablet is taken up by a big, beautiful display. Oddly, LG has placed the webcam off to the left corner of the slate (if you’re holding it in landscape mode, which Android 3.0 encourages you to do). This is also where the company has put the power / sleep / wake button, a somewhat awkward location, as well as the headphone jack and one of the stereo speakers. A volume rocker is nearby on the top left edge of the frame, but weirdly works inverse to the volume slider display — tapping left raises the volume, right lowers it. On the right there’s another speaker, and along bottom you’ll find a mini HDMI port, and Micro USB port, as well as a set of dock sensors.  The gun-metal gray back of the device is intersected by a bold, silver strip which looks like a kickstand, but is actually just a spot for the Google logo to be emblazoned, while the stereoscopic lenses sit on either side. You’ll also notice a small flash and compartment which houses the SIM card.  The device feels unnaturally long; though it has a 8.9-inch screen, it’s longer and thinner than the Xoom (9.56 inches by 5.88 inches). Holding it in your hands in landscape mode seems comically unwieldy, especially when dealing with Android 3.0, which forces your eyes and fingers to jump from corner to corner. In portrait, it predictably feels too tall. It’s unclear why this strange, elongated shape was chosen, but it never felt quite right in my hands. At 1.3 pounds and 0.49 inches thick, it’s not necessarily heavier or thicker than other tablets out there… but it never feels comfortable.  In all, LG has done a reasonably nice job at making a handsome slate, but it’s not a slate one feels particularly compelled to hold onto, nor does its design suggest much in the way of originality.","xoom, youll, gslate, feels, right, corner, tablet, lg, slate, left, review, volume, inches",2011-10-24,The Verge
35,"HP, here's how you can win in mobile",Joshua Topolsky,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/18/hp-heres-how-you-can-win-in-mobile,"I believe the real opportunity lies in the webOS' Synergy, and how that technology might be employed across a wide range of cloud sync services. I asked ""Do you see an opportunity to get into partnerships with companies like Rdio [streaming / cloud services]... Do services like Pandora become less like an app and more like a component of something else?"" to which Steven McArthur replied ""What you're describing is Music Synergy."" Music Synergy? It's clear that streaming services are the next frontier in content consumption, and HP has the chance to be at the forefront with this technology.","On Sunday, PreCentral published an interesting rumor piece based on a leaked slide from HP. According to the story, the company has plans to include a ""music syncing solution"" with the forthcoming TouchPad tablet that will allow users to remotely store and sync music in the cloud -- something like Amazon's new Cloud Drive service, but with a webOS front-end. While this may sound like a great solution to combat Apple's iTunes dominance, I think it's the wrong move for HP and its mobile strategy (if it is, indeed, true). I believe the real opportunity lies in the webOS' Synergy, and how that technology might be employed across a wide range of cloud sync services.  After the introduction of the TouchPad, Pre 3, and Veer, I sat down with Palm / HP mobile honcho Jon Rubinstein and the company's SVP of applications and services, Steven McArthur, for an interview. During that conversation, the topic of Synergy being applied to other services beyond messaging and contacts cropped up, and eventually led to a discussion on the possibility of integrating streaming services into native, webOS hubs. I asked ""Do you see an opportunity to get into partnerships with companies like Rdio [streaming / cloud services]... Do services like Pandora become less like an app and more like a component of something else?"" to which Steven McArthur replied ""What you're describing is Music Synergy."" Music Synergy?  Okay, some background.  In the new version of webOS (3.0) which will premiere with the TouchPad, the photo viewing application will allow Facebook and other photo-sharing sites to plug into its architecture, meaning that you can view and comment on your Facebook content through a native client, which flattens the user interaction and makes transitioning from your personal to cloud photos seamless. It's Photo Synergy in action, and it's a brilliant idea. Windows Phone 7 does this too, but it's limited right now, and there doesn't seem to be a clear path to build it out for more services. With the proliferation of cloud-based services for images, music, video and so on, the complications for an average user to utilize and organize their content has become (and will become) increasingly chaotic and complex. Palm's work with combined services in Synergy means that the company already has a leg up over the competition in making sense of the noise -- which tells me that this is not only a place where HP can excel, it's place where the company can win.  What if HP applied this technology to music applications? What if your Rdio, MOG, Pandora, and even Amazon's Cloud Player (hey, Jon's on the board!) could interface with the native music player in webOS, giving you a familiar, understandable hub to deal with the variety of sources in your life? If HP could allow raw streams coupled with common sets of data to flow through its app (and servers), the utility to an end user would be immediately obvious. It's clear that streaming services are the next frontier in content consumption, and HP has the chance to be at the forefront with this technology. Since HP would be introducing this service on a device with Beats audio, it would also start to paint a picture as the music connoisseur's platform -- HP takes on a personality as the company that's paying attention to the details.  Let's go one step further. Imagine the webOS video application aggregated Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon streaming functions through one interface (similar to how Apple TV handles Netflix now), so that the experience wasn't so much one of diving into and out of an app -- it was more like changing a channel. Users will be praying for a method of dealing with an increasingly scattered landscape, and HP has the tech to answer those prayers. This can be the company's differentiator in mobile. The argument right now between webOS and other platforms is all centered around minutiae; the way it multitasks, notifications, forthcoming enterprise security. Bringing Synergy to video and music services is bold, it's important, and it's something no one else is offering right now -- it's a feature that fringe cases (like yours truly) would applaud, and average users would love instantly.","streaming, win, synergy, cloud, company, users, services, mobile, webos, hp, video, music, heres",2011-04-18,The Verge
36,"LG's Optimus One is a short-term conquest, long-term tragedy",Chris Ziegler,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/17/editorial-lgs-optimus-one-is-a-short-term-conquest-long-term-tragedy,"In fact, say ""Optimus One"" to your average LG Vortex owner, and you’ll get nothing more than a blank stare in return. LG’s miss isn't just a symptom of poor brand management, it’s symptom of virtually everything that’s backwards about the American wireless industry. Take Samsung’s Galaxy S, for example. Samsung and LG, meanwhile, have embraced it with open arms, and they've got the retail floor space to show for it. So if Samsung is selling boatloads of Galaxy S variants and LG is selling boatloads of Optimus One variants, how in the world is this a defeat?","With AT&T’s announcement of the Thrive and Phoenix, LG has pulled off the superfecta: launching materially the same device on all four national US carriers, a feat so rare that I’m pretty sure you can count its occurrences on one hand (in the smartphone era, at least).  The root model — the phone on which all of these launches are based — is the Optimus One, a solid midrange Android device that’s been met with positive reviews and generally happy customers since its launch last year. For LG, it was a global launch in every sense of the word; you can find variants of the Optimus One on almost every continent. Problem is, not a single one of these American phones is called the Optimus One. In fact, say ""Optimus One"" to your average LG Vortex owner, and you’ll get nothing more than a blank stare in return. LG’s somehow managed to take one of the great feats in the smartphone industry — the digital equivalent of a grand slam — and squander most of the positive impact it could've had on the company’s brand perception.  Of course, the story is a little trickier than that. LG’s miss isn't just a symptom of poor brand management, it’s symptom of virtually everything that’s backwards about the American wireless industry. In Europe and most Asian countries outside Japan, the business model is device-centric: you don’t buy an Xperia Play because it’s on Vodafone, you buy it because you like Sony Ericsson and because you want an Xperia Play. Models are more likely to be purchased unbranded, and they’re more likely to be offered directly by more carriers. In the US, meanwhile, everything relies on the misbegotten notion that hardware exclusives are king.  Take Samsung’s Galaxy S, for example. Not one major American carrier launched it true to the original GT-i9000 — they’d all been retooled in one way or another. Granted, Sprint added a keyboard, but T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon made changes just for the sake of differentiation alone. Their endgame involves building loyalty around their own brand, not the manufacturers whose products they carry.  Manufacturers are in a pickle here. I’m sure that if they refuse requests for design changes, carriers will say, ""that’s fine, we've got three other companies on the line who are willing to meet these specifications."" No one — not even behemoths like LG — can afford to abandon the white-hot American phone market out of principle, especially when key models likely command seven-figure quantity commitments. To an extent, I think that’s why Nokia and Sony Ericsson are virtually absent from carrier lineups (and customers’ pockets) here these days: they appear to have been more resistant to the vicious cycle of customization for customization’s sake (the virtually stock Vivaz on AT&T, Astound on T-Mobile, and Xperia Play on Verizon all bear that out). Samsung and LG, meanwhile, have embraced it with open arms, and they've got the retail floor space to show for it.  So if Samsung is selling boatloads of Galaxy S variants and LG is selling boatloads of Optimus One variants, how in the world is this a defeat? At the end of the day, a company’s image is its single greatest asset, and these guys are selling that image to the highest bidder on a daily basis. They’re selling their souls. They need to start quite literally from square one every time they take a device to market, because they've built zero brand equity. There’s a reason why Verizon’s version of the iPhone isn't called the Dynamo or the Thrill or the Amazing: it’s called the iPhone because everyone knows what an iPhone is, and an iPhone is a product that people aspire to own.  It’s actually kind of sick that Samsung has the engineering and manufacturing capacity to produce five-plus versions of the exact same phone, but the one thing they did right was attach the ""Galaxy S"" branding to the tail end of all these models. Of course, no one calls their Captivate ""Captivate, a Galaxy S phone,"" but it’s a start — and it appears to be a glimmer of recognition on Samsung’s part that they need to be putting more effort into cultivating loyalty. The ""Samsung"" logo on the back of the phone isn't enough, especially when a customer walks into a store and realizes there are six Android devices that look exactly alike. And naturally, this is all contingent on these companies refusing stupid design requests (Continuum, we’re looking straight at you) and producing consistently excellent phones across the board; the occasional mega-success like the Galaxy S and the Optimus One isn't enough to get it done when you’re counterbalancing it with mediocre models that sour buyers on your brand.  Because if you don’t get customers coming into AT&T stores and saying ""I want an Optimus One,"" LG, you’re nameless — and I’m willing to bet that ZTE, Huawei, and half a dozen others would love to take your place for half the cost.","s, samsung, galaxy, selling, longterm, shortterm, lg, phone, models, isnt, conquest, lgs, optimus, tragedy, thats",2011-04-17,The Verge

41,BlackBerry PlayBook review,Joanna Stern,https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2510576/blackberry-playbook-review,"Overall UI / look and feelTo understand the PlayBook UI, you need only really understand Palm’s (and now HP’s) webOS. When you first boot up the PlayBook, you’re presented with a homescreen that isn’t wildly dissimilar from BlackBerry OS 6. In general, the PlayBook OS feels like it’s on the ice level of a Mega Man game — everything seems to be sliding away beyond your control. BlackBerry Bridge / Email / CalendarOne of the most astounding oversights with the PlayBook is the fact that there’s no native email, calendar, or contacts for the device out of the box. The only way at launch to use those services is to pair the device with a BlackBerry handset over Bluetooth, using a protocol RIM is calling BlackBerry Bridge.","While the PlayBook is meaningful from a hardware perspective, what really matters here is the brand new OS Research In Motion is introducing. Built atop the supposedly rock-solid QNX platform, this tablet’s operating system is a fresh start for the company, touting a completely revamped look and feel, and new application frameworks, including support for native development, Adobe Air, Java, and RIM’s WebWorks… oh, and Android too, as a virtual machine at least.  Not only is the underlying architecture new, but the user interface has been rebuilt as well, and now features at least a few flourishes from the recently acquired TAT. It’s pretty clear The Astonishing Tribe has been at work in the PlayBook OS, and there are lots of playful little touches that make this device feel far more polished and modern than anything RIM has done in a long while.  Overall UI / look and feel  To understand the PlayBook UI, you need only really understand Palm’s (and now HP’s) webOS. This tablet’s interface owes much to its underdog competitor, but most obvious is the way in which this UI deals with multitasking, application switching, and task management. When you first boot up the PlayBook, you’re presented with a homescreen that isn’t wildly dissimilar from BlackBerry OS 6. Along the top of the screen is a status bar with the time and date, orientation lock, Bluetooth control, WiFi indicator, battery indicator, and settings icon. Below this is a space for your applications when running — applications exist in a ""card"" view which can be navigated left to right, like Cover Flow. Underneath that section is a drawer for your apps which can be raised and lowered with a swipe of the finger. Those applications are further grouped into tabs depending on their category.  There are five gestures which allow you to navigate the OS. A swipe up from the bottom bezel while in an application will take you to card view (and your homescreen), while the same gesture in the card view will bring up your app drawer and also close it. A swipe downward from the top of the bezel while in an app will reveal more chrome, allowing you to explore options or make other selections (in the browser, for instance, it brings up your tabs and option icon). If you perform the downward swipe on the homescreen, you get a dropdown menu of all tablet settings. While in an application, a swipe from the left or right bezel will take you to another application, while swiping down from the upper right- or left-hand corner will reveal your status bar. A swipe from the lower left-hand corner brings up the keyboard. Other than those special gestures, the PlayBook features pinch-to-zoom in the browser, maps, and photo viewer.  Getting around in the OS is intuitive and elegant, but truth be told, webOS does a better job with managing cards, both in the feel of moving through them and with the new stacks feature in webOS 2.0, which lets you group related activities. Weirdly, the PlayBook has this flowing sense of over-inertia, as if RIM hasn’t cranked the physics down, so that when you’re flipping through cards you often miss the one you wanted to select and it goes flying by you. In general, the PlayBook OS feels like it’s on the ice level of a Mega Man game — everything seems to be sliding away beyond your control. It’s a sloppy feeling, and that’s compounded by the fact that the OS doesn’t seem to be fully optimized for touch input yet; I found myself tapping and re-tapping on UI elements and web navigation with no result. In web apps like Gmail (which RIM provides a direct link to on the homescreen), I couldn’t get to certain message checkboxes even after double-digit attempts. Whether this is the overall UI acting buggy or an issue with the way the browser is interpreting touches is unclear, but it’s that sort of behavior which makes the product feel unfinished.  On the plus side, the OS shows tremendous promise, and some of the UI touches that TAT has brought to the table are really charming, like the history of your calculator functions which you can virtually rip off to discard. Other places you see the TAT brilliance poking through are in the photo browser, where pictures don’t just scroll left to right, but overlap each other, shadows and all. It’s those kinds of details that breathe life into this device, and show a path to a brighter future for RIM — unfortunately, there’s just not enough of it to go around right now.  BlackBerry Bridge / Email / Calendar      One of the most astounding oversights with the PlayBook is the fact that there’s no native email, calendar, or contacts for the device out of the box. The only way at launch to use those services is to pair the device with a BlackBerry handset over Bluetooth, using a protocol RIM is calling BlackBerry Bridge. I only had a short time to test this functionality, as the early version of the PlayBook software did not have access to Bridge mode.  Firstly, it’s inconceivable to me that anyone at RIM thought it was a smart play to cut off non-BlackBerry users from the most basic functionality you expect on a device of this type. Not being able to access your email via a native client is insanity as far as I’m concerned, and the first few days I had the PlayBook without email, contacts, or my calendars, the device felt nearly useless.  Once the Bridge was enabled, the shared content was relatively easy to work with, though I did notice some issues. For starters, if you’re a Gmail user utilizing RIM’s Gmail plugin, you’ll be out of luck on the PlayBook — it formats your messages to standard BlackBerry style (no threading, no stars, no labels). More frustrating is the fact that there seems to be lag between when you delete or move messages on the PlayBook and when they’re actually dealt with on the phone and server. I had some troubling moments at the start where I simply couldn’t extinguish emails — the headers just sat in my inbox, empty but unmovable. I eventually had to reconcile the messages on my Torch to get them cleared. That’s not to say the implementation is clunky — it isn’t — but it isn’t exactly perfect. It’s unclear why RIM couldn’t simply allow you to plug in your account information on the device itself, but I assume it has something to do with the company’s high security standards. It’s nice of them to think of it, but for most users, the lack of an easy option for email will be more troubling than security concerns. Even for current BlackBerry users, this seems like a roundabout way to get at your important content.  And for you BBM fanatics, some bad news. At this point in time, Bridge requires that a new version of BBM be used to get those message on your PlayBook… so using that functionality on your new tablet is in the hands of RIM now, and it was unclear if that would be resolved by the launch date.  Browser  The PlayBook’s browser is a modified and enhanced variation on the Torch’s new Webkit-powered version — and it’s come a long way. For starters, most pages I visited were displayed perfectly on the device, with tablet-enhanced sites such as Gmail displaying as they do on the iPad. Page load times were snappy, and scrolling and pinch-to-zoom worked flawlessly, though occasionally there did seem to be some of that UI sluggishness / touchiness that I mentioned earlier.  What’s most impressive about the PlayBook’s browser, however, is that it’s probably the first mobile web browser I’ve ever used that actually handles Flash properly. In fact, this is as close as you can get to a desktop / laptop Flash experience on a tablet — at least with video. That means full 1080p YouTube playback in the browser with no stutter, no lag, and no slowdown on the device overall. Unfortunately, the PlayBook isn’t quite as adept at handling other types of Flash content, such as games — in fact, most online Flash games I tried to play were far too sluggish to have any real fun with. It’s clear that RIM has optimized around video playback (it’s hardware accelerated), and that’s nice, but it still doesn’t prove that Flash works for mobile devices.","right, ui, way, playbook, os, flash, browser, rim, device, review, blackberry, swipe",2011-10-24,The Verge
42,Steve and Eric's multitouch showdown,Nilay Patel,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/12/steve-and-erics-multitouch-showdown,"So Steven Levy's new book In the Plex has a story about Steve Jobs seeing pinch-to-zoom in Android 1.0 and basically ending what had been a very positive relationship between Apple and Google. It's a juicy story, but one that seems just a bit off to me, so I wrote up a post on my personal blog with all the unanswered questions. It's crazy to think that we tracked the Android multitouch story so closely for so long and now it's totally off the radar -- I'd love to know what actually happened behind the scenes.","So Steven Levy's new book In the Plex has a story about Steve Jobs seeing pinch-to-zoom in Android 1.0 and basically ending what had been a very positive relationship between Apple and Google.

44,"Intel details Cedar Trail Atoms, but are netbooks even relevant?",Nilay Patel,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/11/intel-details-cedar-trail-atoms-but-are-netbooks-even-relevant,"Joanna scored some early details on Intel's next-generation Cedar Trail Atom processors, and they seem like a solid update: WiDi and Intel Wireless music will be making their way to netbooks in this generation, as will some easier file-syncing features. Intel's also promising a boost in performance, 1080p / Blu-ray playback, and lower power and heat that will allow for thinner fanless netbook designs. But as we've been wondering for so long, the real question is whether or not netbooks are even still relevant -- AMD Fusion machines are nearly as cheap and offer far more power, and the low-end of the market is being eaten by the iPad. Joanna's got some thoughts on that and an interview with Intel's Bill Kircos over on her personal blog, go check it.","Joanna scored some early details on Intel's next-generation Cedar Trail Atom processors, and they seem like a solid update: WiDi and Intel Wireless music will be making their way to netbooks in this generation, as will some easier file-syncing features.

49,This is my next project,Joshua Topolsky,https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/03/this-is-my-next-project,"Earlier this evening, David Carr published a piece in the New York Times about a new project that I'm embarking on... and I want to just say a few things about it. I've decided to join the team at SB Nation to build something brand new in the tech space. Of course, the natural question I'm sure a lot of people have is: why SB Nation? The easy answer is that the people at SB Nation share my vision of what publishing looks like in the year 2011. But beyond the technology (and possibly more important than the technology), there's another factor here that's driving my decision.","As you may have already heard (or read), there's some activity going on in the world of Joshua Topolsky. Earlier this evening, David Carr published a piece in the New York Times about a new project that I'm embarking on... and I want to just say a few things about it.  Firstly: yes, this is happening. I've decided to join the team at SB Nation to build something brand new in the tech space. Now I know it might seem odd to some that I would be partnering with a sports publisher to build a technology news site, but that's only half the story. This isn't just about sports, or tech, or lone silos. What we will build together at SB Nation is a new media company -- buoyed by the absolutely incredible work SB Nation has already done in publishing -- and part of that new media company will be the as-yet-unnamed gadget and technology site that I'll be working over the next few months to create. When we launch (hopefully in the fall), I will be editor-in-chief of a property that I hope will inform, entertain, and engage fans of technology in whole new ways.  I should say that I wouldn't want to build something like this alone, and thankfully, I won't have to. I'll be joined by some very good friends at this new venture -- people like Nilay Patel, for instance.  Of course, the natural question I'm sure a lot of people have is: why SB Nation? The easy answer is that the people at SB Nation share my vision of what publishing looks like in the year 2011. They think that the technology used to create and distribute news on the web (and mobile) is as important as the people who are responsible for the content itself. And that's not just pillow talk -- SB Nation is actively evolving its tools and processes to meet the growing and changing needs of its vast editorial teams and their audience communities. They're building for the web as it is now. From the perspective of a journalist who also happens to be a huge nerd, that's a match made in heaven. SBN isn't just another media company pushing news out -- it's a testbed and lab for some of the newest and most interesting publishing tools I've ever seen. In short, I was blown away when I saw what kind of technology they're using to get news on their front page and engage audiences, and even more blown away when I started talking to them about what could come next.  But beyond the technology (and possibly more important than the technology), there's another factor here that's driving my decision. It's that SB Nation believes in real, independent journalism and the potential for new media to serve as an answer and antidote to big publishing houses and SEO spam -- a point we couldn't be more aligned on. This is a group of people that not only think independent media works, but are reaping the rewards of new publishing done right. As the fastest growing online sports publisher, they're seen as a source for credible and honest journalism, which is why industry stalwarts like Rob Neyer have recently joined their ranks (ranks which include hundreds of talented sports experts). This isn't tabloid page grabbing or content farming -- it's news and insight by and for a passionate and informed group of people. And that's exactly where I want to be.  So, what happens next? We get to work.  In the coming months I'm going to be laser focused on one thing: building the best tech site in the world -- and I would love to hear what you guys think the next phase in technology and gadget news should look like. Ping me with ideas, gripes, or even better -- come and work here! SB Nation is looking for new developers as we speak, and as we ramp up to launch, we'll be bringing on lots of talent to work both on the front page and behind the scenes.","sb, technology, project, nation, think, work, build, theyre, publishing, media, thats",2011-04-03,The Verge
